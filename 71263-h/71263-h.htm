<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>STONY BROKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ever</span> since the “first breakfast,” groups of passengers
had been trooping down the gang-plank, hurrying with
guide-book and satchel to “do” Naples, Vesuvius,
Pompeii, etc., before the steamer should sail again in
the evening. An angular chap in proper steamer
<i>négligé</i> lounged contentedly on the starboard rail and
watched them go. By eight o’clock he seemed to have
the starboard rail to himself.</p>

<p>At that hour he was leaning heavily forward, presumably
watching the ant-like stevedores loading and
unloading the steamer, but he was quite aware of another
lone passenger, slowly moving towards him. He
had seen her come on at Genoa—anyone would have
noticed the clean-cut, tailor-made figure—and on the
journey from Genoa to Naples he had noted her once or
twice striding the deck alone; but he did not know even
so much as her name. He did not know her, but, as
she came up to him and lingered at the starboard rail,
he knew instinctively that he would borrow money
from her.</p>

<p>She stopped beside him for a moment and observed
the Italian workers. He did not once look up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>“Do you know how long we stay in Naples?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Shipboard etiquette ignores introductions.</p>

<p>“We sail at nine to-night, the Captain says.” He
turned his head slightly and smiled as if he had really
known her. She lounged over the rail and helped him
watch the workers. From the dock below this pair
looked like familiar companions.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” she exclaimed suddenly. “What time
is it now?”</p>

<p>“Eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>” He seem amused in a superior way.</p>

<p>“All day in this hot dirty place!” she exclaimed
again.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> warm,” he admitted, “but not unpleasantly
so. Dirty? Ye-es, on the wharf; but look back of
you.” He hardly moved from his lounging posture.
“Behold! The Bay of Naples. ‘See Naples and
die’; that phrase is sure to be in your guide-book.
There’s a lot of other poetry about it, too: ‘The blue
Bay of Naples, cerulean blue——’”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t blue,” she objected. “It’s dirty grey
and,”—she looked directly below for an instant—“and
it’s oily—greasy, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it is blue,” he contradicted firmly; “deep
cerulean blue, the blue of sapphire shading off to mother-of-pearl.”
As he talked he half turned towards her.
He was tall—she was not; his face was bronzed,
and furrowed with lines—hers was not; so without
offence he could assume a schoolmasterly air of genial
superiority.</p>

<p>“Quite blue—from the top of that hill.”</p>

<p>He pointed above the tiers of grey-tiled roofs to a
pleasant prospect of trees. “The blue is there, but
you must climb for it. You can’t expect the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
glorious panorama in the world to present itself to you
without some effort on your part.”</p>

<p>“What’s the name of that hill?” she asked aimlessly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. There’s a charming inn there, I
suspect.”</p>

<p>“You suspect? Don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you been there yourself?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then how do you know about the ‘glorious
panorama’?”</p>

<p>“You get a similar sensation from the hill over
there,” he flourished a hand; “a much smaller hill.
So I drew the proper inference.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been on <i>that</i> hill?” she flourished a
hand in imitation of the man.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well!”</p>

<p>“Well,” he smiled. “The view is there just the
same—and the blue, too. If you don’t believe me, go
up and see. I’m willing to stake my judgment to the
extent of——”</p>

<p>He stopped so abruptly and smiled so mysteriously
that she was attracted to say:</p>

<p>“To the extent of how much? You wouldn’t
risk a dollar on your ‘glorious view’! Now, would
you?”</p>

<p>He speculated for a moment. “No,” he admitted
finally. “I wouldn’t risk a dollar on any of my views.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she triumphed.</p>

<p>“A fog might come up,” he explained lamely.</p>

<p>“There!” said she. “Naples is over-advertised by
sick poets. Look about you. It’s incredibly ugly—and
smelly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“What’s wrong about the smells?” he inquired
mildly.</p>

<p>She laughed. “Garlic, mostly,” she took a delicate
sniff, “and paint.”</p>

<p>“Garlic, I admit,” he sniffed in turn, “and paint,
and even tar; but they are merely the dominant notes.
The overtones give this spot distinction. I’m a connoisseur
on smells. It’s a lost art.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!”</p>

<p>“Not at all. We have lost the knowledge of odours;
therefore a great part of life is lost. Do you notice
now the smell of resin?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“They’re unloading resin in sacks from that schooner
with the black sails. Think hard for a moment and
you’ll get it. It is a delicious scent quite unlike
anything else.”</p>

<p>“No,” she tried, “I don’t get it. But I smell oil,
horribly.”</p>

<p>“That’s from the tanker,” he pointed. “It should
strike your national pride. It’s U.S.A.—Standard
Oil.”</p>

<p>“Standard Oil?” she inquired eagerly and shaded
her eyes to spell out the name on the side. “So it is!
U-m-m!” she sniffed, “that smells good. I own
Standard Oil Stock. U-m! Not much, of course—but—u-m!—enough.”</p>

<p>Yes, he would borrow; but now he knew he would not
pay back; perhaps not. He let her chatter on while
he listened gravely or added a word or question to set
her going again. In a short while he knew the main
points of her life and some of the details; and she
believed—so perfect is the illusion of a one-sided conversation—that
he had given as much in exchange. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
the woman they seemed infinitely acquainted after the
first half-hour. She was very young, one could be sure;
she had the frankness, the unsuspicious frankness of
twenty-five; which, nevertheless, is very artful and
quite conscious of itself. The man did not misjudge
her; he knew he was not dealing with a child, but
with a thoroughly independent and responsible young
person.</p>

<p>And he knew also that he was stony broke.</p>

<p>The half-hours sped as they talked. Two bells
followed closely by a single stroke clanged suddenly
from the fore part of the ship.</p>

<p>She made a brisk attempt to look at a watch.</p>

<p>“No use,” she put the watch back. “I have Paris
time. Three bells is, let me see—‘eight’ is eight and
‘one’ is half-past eight——”</p>

<p>“It is half-past nine,” he helped, as if it did not
matter how the day sped.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” she exclaimed. “Have we wasted an
hour and a half just talking?”</p>

<p>“So it seems.”</p>

<p>“I won’t stay here all day. I’ve just got to get on
land. Why, man, I’ve never seen Naples or Pompeii or—any
of those places,” waving a hand about. “If I
had my dog here I’d go it alone. I’ve been in worse
places. Why, I believe there’s nobody on the ship
but us!”</p>

<p>She looked around. It seemed so.</p>

<p>Smudgy-faced members of the crew appeared here
and there, the sort that the passengers ordinarily never
see on voyage; cooks, vegetable carriers and knife boys
called across barriers to one another; and off in the
distance an officer could be observed coatless and heavily
suspendered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“Why aren’t you going on shore?” she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>“I?” he parried. “Not interested.”</p>

<p>“Not interested in Naples and Pompeii?” she inquired
incredulously. “Oh, you’ve been there before,
I see.”</p>

<p>“No; I’ve never been there. I—uh—just prefer to—uh—stay
here.... I like to be alone.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” cheerily.</p>

<p>She looked at him expectantly.</p>

<p>He took some time before he said serenely, “I can’t
say it.”</p>

<p>“What?” But she knew what.</p>

<p>“The obvious complimentary thing. A woman does
that with amazing skill,” he mused. “She directs a
conversation into a position where the man must make
her a pretty speech. Oh, it’s all right; but it interferes
shockingly.”</p>

<p>“Interferes with what?” This time she did not
know what.</p>

<p>“With any rational conversation,” he explained
calmly. “I don’t mind your company. In fact, I have
enjoyed it. But I do like to be alone. I’ve spent most
of my life alone. On this trip abroad I’ve fought my
right to be my own travelling-companion. These are
just facts, like the boat’s sailing to-night at nine; but a
man can’t tell them to a pretty woman (“Thank you,”
she slipped in) without her pretending to take them
personally. So she says ‘thank you!’—only in jest,
I know—and then I must say some foolish flattery, but
the conversation is—well, it cannot go on with the
same directness with which a man talks to a man....
You see I’m not complaining. This is just another
fact. I’m really interested in it.... Men are forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
to treat women like pretty children. Why do women
stand it?”</p>

<p>“They don’t always like it,” she wrinkled her forehead
and puzzled over the matter, “but men are such
‘jolliers,’ you know.”</p>

<p>“Fancy a man flattering another man!” he went on.
The idea interested him. He seemed to be forgetting
the woman beside him; certainly he had completely forgotten
the thought born of her first approach, that she
was just the sort of person to have plenty of money—somebody
else’s, a father’s or a husband’s—and to
offer it, too. Of course he had not intended to ask for
anything. He knew enough to know that she would
lend. He had been in that precise predicament before.
Money had always come to him. You see, if he had
looked the part of poor-man, beggar-man, thief, the world
would have turned coldly away; but he was built on
mighty prosperous lines. One felt, at the first glance,
that here was an athletic aristocrat. He was just that
in reality; but he was mortgaged to the last hedge-row.</p>

<p>So the thought of taking her predestined offer of
money slipped from him. He was not a scheming mind.
The gods took care of such things. Let them! The
important matter just now was the consideration of the
droll picture of two males saying sweet things apropos
of each other’s eyes and noses.</p>

<p>He chuckled. “Fancy trying to have a discussion
with a man on the subject, say, of a possible life after
death, and have him lean over, stare at the top of your
head, and with a tremendous assumption of interest exclaim,
‘Jove, man, I do like the way you brushed your
hair this morning! With the sun striking the brown
edges it is absolutely stunning!’”</p>

<p>They discussed flattery and women. The man slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
forgot his reserve, while the woman, with subtle native
flattery, listened. Four bells rang out sharply from
forward, repeated far off in the engine-room below.
Ten o’clock.</p>

<p>“Well!” the lady exclaimed. “Perhaps I should
prefer to see Naples and Pompeii alone, but I haven’t
the nerve. I’m willing to knock around in Paris or
London, but when it comes to Italy I’m scared. The
men look at me, especially the toughs, in a way that
makes my flesh creep. Goodness knows <i>I</i> wish men
would forget I’m a woman, but they don’t seem to want
to.... See here ... why can’t we take the trip together?
Oh, I’d let you be practically alone,” she
answered his quick uplook. “You’d just be there as a
protection.... Will you?”</p>

<p>He turned his head and regarded her quizzically, like
an amused elder brother. He was older. His clean-shaven
face had a medley of lines in it which showed
superior years.</p>

<p>“I should be delighted,” he remarked. His intonation
carried precisely the information that his phrase
was absolutely polite and absolutely non-committal.</p>

<p>“Oh, rot!” she laughed, but she showed impatience.
“Don’t be so foolish and conventional. You do want
to see the place. You said you did. And I want to
go, too. It’s nothing extraordinary. It’s just the
same as if I asked you to play shuffle-board. Honest,
you do want to go; don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he half-drawled, but made no effort to move
from a convenient sprawl over the rail.</p>

<p>“Then let’s,” she begged. “This place is making
me ill.... Oh, very well,” she took his silence for
obstinacy. “I’ll stay.... No, I won’t. I’ll be
hanged if I do. The heat is too much and the smells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
are worse. I’ll risk it. I’ll go it alone.... <i>Why</i>
won’t you go with me?”</p>

<p>He searched in his pockets carefully and finally
presented a flat leather wallet.</p>

<p>“You force me to admit my very embarrassing position.”
As he fumbled with the strap on the wallet she
understood. The word “embarrassing” was in itself
illuminating.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she gasped, shocked at her own stupidity.
What an idiot! She had been gabbling to this man
when all the while he had been warning her to keep off!</p>

<p>By this time he had opened the wallet and had
drawn from its case a single five-dollar bill.</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> is why,” he remarked. “I am down to five
dollars, which I must not touch until I land in New
York. That five dollars is my sole anchor to windward.
Fortunately meals and sleeping-apartment are
paid for on board; but my ticket says nothing about
side-trips. Therefore I should not dare step on that
gang-plank. I consider myself lucky—mighty lucky—to
arrive on board so safe financially as this. Forgive
me for the confession; but you must admit that you
forced it. Awfully sorry, too; for, now that you
understand, I don’t mind telling you that this is the
hottest, dirtiest, ill-smellingest spot imaginable. Would
I like to go to the top of that hill and look my fill and
breathe!” He straightened up suddenly. “<i>Lord!</i>”</p>

<p>“Then let’s go!” she cried. “Let’s! I’ve got
money; heaps of it.” She dived into a bag she carried
with her. “Look here!” she flashed a packet of
various coloured bank-notes. In an inner compartment
she showed him a mixture of sovereigns and gold
louis. “The purser will give me Italian money. He
said he would this morning. Wait! I’ll get a hat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>She sped across the deck and around the corner
before he could protest. To her stateroom she went
first and added a veil about her hat, selected a parasol
and donned long thin gloves. Then to the purser’s.</p>

<p>“What time do we sail to-night?” she asked as the
official made the change of money.</p>

<p>“To-night?” he echoed. “We stay here until
to-morrow morning. We sail at six to-morrow. There
is a notice posted.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, and sped to the bulletin-board.
In three languages the purser was verified. In
a moment more she was back on the promenade-deck.</p>

<p>“Here!” she gave him a small purse. “You’ll have
to do the spending. Come on! It’ll be a great lark.
We still have time. There’s a <i>voiture</i> or whatever they
call it. He’s looking up. He’ll take us somewhere.
Come on! Oh, it’s all right! It’s on me. My treat.
Come on! Don’t be foolish.... Now, what’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>He had accepted the purse; but otherwise he had
not moved.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” he spoke with quiet authority. “I
can’t do this as your treat.”</p>

<p>“Let me hire you as a guide, then,” she ventured.</p>

<p>“No,” he laughed; “I——”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s Dutch it, then. We’ll divide expenses—you
pay me in New York.”</p>

<p>“I won’t have anything in New York but five
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Pay it back whenever you get it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he agreed quietly. “But——”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“That may be a long while.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I want to see Naples.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“I’m not over-careful about paying debts. I’m likely
to repudiate,” he warned. “My memory is almost
useless.”</p>

<p>“Well, leave it to me in your will and—hurry!”</p>

<p>Five bells tolled off smartly. The lady strode
forward and tugged at his arm. He laughed quietly
and followed.</p>

<p>“Really,” he told her as they slid down the steep
plank, “I’m awfully keen for this trip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you are—not,” she looked him over with a
meaning glance. “But I don’t care. I couldn’t stay
on that boat all day. There’s that <i>cocher</i>. Quick, get
him before he drives away. I love those old dinky
carriages, don’t you? Hey!” she called and waved a
parasol. “<i>Ici!</i> Come over here! We want to get
in!”</p>

<p>The Italian understood perfectly. And where would
madame and m’sieu wish to go? To the Italian all
well-dressed foreigners are French.</p>

<p>“To the top of that hill first,” the madame commanded.
M’sieu remarked, “We must not get too far
away. We sail at nine to-night; and clocks are not
very dependable in these parts.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we must be careful about the time,” she
agreed, but offered no word of the more recent information
she had received from the purser. “We can have
one good glorious dinner somewhere and be back easily
by half-past eight,” she told him.</p>

<p>They had turned a corner of the creaking winding
road which gave suddenly a little glimpse of the
Bay.</p>

<p>“Look!” she exclaimed. They turned their heads.
“It is beginning to be blue already! U-m!” she
sniffed. “Did you get that delicious scent? What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
is it? Lilac?... And look over there! Still
bluer.”</p>

<p>“Cerulean blue, every yard of it guaranteed,” he
remarked lazily; but there was no doubt he was taking
it in as eagerly as she. To the lady this was one of
many possible trips abroad. To the man it was a
sight of Italy, almost withheld like the Promised Land
from Moses of old, now made a reality; the promise
fulfilled of seven years’ mean living.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he exclaimed on one rise of ground;
the assumption of indifference was hard to keep up.
“By Jove!” he stared and breathed in the perfumed
air. “This is paradise! And Italians come to America
to clean the streets and sell fruit! How can they leave
it? How ever can they leave it?”</p>

<p>The “dinky” carriage plodded slowly up the hill.
The grey tile-topped roofs began to huddle together
below them. Old Vesuvius grew to look less like a flat
ash-heap. Far off in the background ranges of higher
hills began to push solemnly skyward. And the Bay
of Naples slowly expanded, and softened, and yielded
up its velvet blue.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it great?” the lady said, gazing afar.</p>

<p>“Great!” the man replied. “Wonderful!”</p>

<p>So absorbed were they in their personal sensations of
delight that it was not until they had arrived at the
top and were moving on the level towards a “hotel with
a view,” that the thoughts of luncheon coupled themselves
somehow with the thought of names.</p>

<p>From a dangling bag the lady had produced a
“steamer-list.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me yet,” she warned. “This is tremendously
exciting. I am wondering if you could be, let
me see—‘Abbott’—no,” she looked him over carefully—“you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
never would be an ‘Abbott.’ ‘Bacon,’ ‘Baker,’
‘Boileau,’ ‘Crespi’—you might be that, especially
when you spoke Italian to the driver. ‘Dr.’—you’re
not a doctor, are you?” She showed some dismay.</p>

<p>“Guess on!” he played the game firmly.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one thing you’re not,” she pointed to
the “list.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward to read the name. The wagonette
was stopping with a lurch at the spacious beflowered
front of a hotel.</p>

<p>“‘Sir Richard Helvyn,’” she laughed.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he inquired mildly.</p>

<p>“Don’t scare me,” she laughed inquiringly. “Are
you?”</p>

<p>The happy driver was waiting at the open door,
whip in hand, smiling knowingly. A bride and groom,
perhaps. The tip would betray them. Beside him a
flunkey or two were ready to escort the pair into the
hotel. A wizened beggar-woman raised silent-speaking
eyes and extended a hand. The m’sieu opened a thin
deep purse, obviously a lady’s—and extracted therefrom
a gold coin and a smaller one of silver.</p>

<p>“That will be exactly right,” he nodded to the
driver, who, after one glance, was now certain—they
were veritable bride and groom.</p>

<p>Deftly, almost without looking, he dropped the silver
coin into the palm of the beggar. It was done with
skill; and it said, “Begone, my good woman; the sight
of you arouses my pity, but do not, pray, take it to
mean a soft heart; and whatever you do, breathe not
my generosity to your pestilential fellows.”</p>

<p>The woman understood, smiled gratefully, and slipped
away.</p>

<p>The smoothness of the two transactions was not lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
on the “bride.” There had been no noisy, staccato
expostulations from the driver, nor any sickening
whines from the beggar; the business was handled
with the dispatch of accustomed skill. Could he be
Sir What’s-his-name, after all? What a lark!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> antiquated horse had taken all the time until
noon to reach the summit, so the inn-keeper had rushed
instantly to provide the lady and gentleman with a
private dining-room. It had a trellised portico overlooking
the Bay. Here they sat and gazed. They
forgot, for the moment, the interrupted conversation
over “names”; even the broad suggestion of “bride
and groom” that beamed from the faces of the driver,
the hotel porters, mine host himself in the doorway
and, afar off, mine hostess. The panorama of Naples
took rank above everything else.</p>

<p>“No wonder the poets tried so hard to tell us about
this,” she spoke finally.</p>

<p>“But I do wonder,” he returned. “How could they
be such egotists? No writing can do justice to that,”
he pointed towards the deeper blue; “one might as well
try to score it for kettle-drums. It can’t be translated.
All landscape poetry is a failure, a failure from the
start. It can’t be conveyed to others.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she mused, “the poet was not interested
in others. Perhaps he wished merely to celebrate
himself.”</p>

<p>He turned towards her suddenly.</p>

<p>“You touch me hard there,” he said. “Do you
know whom you’re quoting?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Yes. Whitman.”</p>

<p>“Do you know Whitman—really know him?”</p>

<p>“How blunt you are,” but she showed no resentment.
“Yes, I really know Whitman. Also, I hereby give
notice that I am much less frivolous than I look.”</p>

<p>“I’m a little daft on Whitman,” he apologized.</p>

<p>“So am I.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think he is immoral?” he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>“I think he is super-moral.”</p>

<p>“You do know him, then,” he admitted, half-aloud.</p>

<p>“Any more cross-examination?”</p>

<p>“How did you come to take to Whitman?” This
was the first time he had seemed to suggest any interest
in her personally. She noted the change in him, but
gave no sign.</p>

<p>“The Woman’s Club,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Penn Yan.”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>”</p>

<p>“Penn Yan.”</p>

<p>“China?”</p>

<p>“No, Penn Yan, a town of 4,000 inhabitants in New
York. I live there.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Dear me! Haven’t you heard of Penn Yan?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Not heard of the Walker Bin Company?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Nor the Birkett Mills?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Nor the ‘Benham House’?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Nor Quackenbush’s chain of two drug stores?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“No.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she affected delightful concern.</p>

<p>“Surely you have heard of Lake Keuka, and the
Keuka grape vineyards?” She leaned forward with
mischief in her eyes.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever eaten a grape, my dear Sir Knight?”</p>

<p>“Possibly.”</p>

<p>“A good, great, luscious blue grape?”</p>

<p>“Possibly.”</p>

<p>“Only possibly?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he hesitated, “y-es. Yes; I am sure to have
eaten one. Now that I put my mind to it, I recall that
it was especially large and sweet and——”</p>

<p>She leaned back, contented.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>that</i> was a Keuka Lake grape.”</p>

<p>He was studying her, as one would a specimen of the
thing you collect.</p>

<p>“Is Penn—Penn Ying——”</p>

<p>“Penn Yan, please.”</p>

<p>“Is Penn Yan your summer home or——”</p>

<p>“It is my all-the-year home. I was born there.
This is my first adventure from the family hearth.”</p>

<p>Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm might have made that
speech.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he remarked. “Ah! That explains
much.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” she smiled. “Spring it. What’s the
answer? What is the ‘much’ my living in Penn Yan
explains?”</p>

<p>“You are charmingly of the village; for which I am
grateful. Otherwise, we should not have been on this
delightfully unconventional trip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must see Penn Yan,” she chirped, “especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
on Saturday night. Our Main Street is paved,”
she added archly, “and we have an electric line and
sweetly subdued arc-lights. But of course I don’t live
in the throbbing town—that would be too exciting.
We live far off down the Lake, in Jerusalem township.
You see, Sir—Sir——” she hesitated, plucked out her
steamer-list and went on, “—Sir Richard, we are really
not even villagers; we are, I fear, hopelessly rural.”</p>

<p>Her satiric tone was not lost on “Sir Richard.” He
would have been stupid else.</p>

<p>“Rural? Not a doubt of it!” he admitted. “You
lend me money on sight and take me for a title and no
questions asked. What makes you think I am Sir
Richard?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so now; and I’m awfully sorry. Your
enunciation is sort of English—you know—clear,
broad vowels, lots of sharp ‘t’s,’ no ‘r’s’ to speak of;
but you haven’t once said, ‘Quite so,’ or ‘Really!’ or
‘Silly ass!’”</p>

<p>“I am half English. I went to school in England.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she mimicked. “That explains much—ah!—much!
And was it a school in the country?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” he explained eagerly. “Quite in the country.
It was an omnibus and two trains away from
London.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” She “ah-ed” very significantly, and added,
“Much! Ah, much—much.”</p>

<p>“We’re even,” he owned.</p>

<p>“Only even?” she opened her eyes very wide.</p>

<p>He was about to surrender completely when the host
in the doorway announced luncheon.</p>

<p>It was a cosy, intimate dining-room; small table set
for two; uniformed butler standing rigid off to the side;
maid, also in uniform, moving swiftly in and out a door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and serving deftly—exactly the suggestion of a dinner
<i>en famille</i>.</p>

<p>“That is the head of the table, dear,” said the lady.</p>

<p>The man was so startled, especially when he glanced
back to the placid, innocent face of the lady, that he
neglected to take any place at all.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see that this is a domestic scene?” she
explained; “regular man-and-wife stage-set. They expect
it of us.... Beautiful, expensive scenery,” she
murmured, “spoiled by a wretched actor.”</p>

<p>Then she nodded her head towards the uniformed
attendant, and began again.</p>

<p>“That is the head of the table, I think, <i>dear</i>.”</p>

<p>He grinned and made for the seat.</p>

<p>“That is the head; is it not, <i>my dear</i>?” she persisted.</p>

<p>“It is,” he agreed.</p>

<p>She declined to sit.</p>

<p>“It is—what, <i>my dear</i>?”</p>

<p>“It is the head of the table.”</p>

<p>“The head of the table, <i>my</i>——”</p>

<p>She cocked her head and waited to catch the completed
phrase.</p>

<p>“<i>Dear!</i>” he finished, not without embarrassment.</p>

<p>“You miss your cues dreadfully,” she went on
briskly. “Tell the gendarme to pass the rolls, Richard
dear.”</p>

<p>“Madame will have the rolls,” “Richard” managed
in Italian. “I don’t think the gendarme comprehends
English, so your little domestic playette is wasted, my—uh—darling.”</p>

<p>“Thenk you, m’lud,” the gendarme remarked in good
cockney as he deftly removed the rolls and started
towards madame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“You’re English?” m’lud ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Me, m’lud? Yes, thenk you, m’lud.”</p>

<p>“The devil!”</p>

<p>“Yes, thenk you, m’lud. And would m’lady prefer
the toasted muffins?”</p>

<p>M’lady preferred nothing so much as the open enjoyment
of m’lud’s discomfiture. There was a certain
boldness and a certain shyness about m’lud, typical of
England. At present the awkward self-consciousness
was to the fore. It was consuming him, although he
was intelligent enough to know exactly his trouble and
its remedy. Therefore he laughed, owned up to the
embarrassment and summoned his will to fight it
down.</p>

<p>“Even Half-English is still very English,” she told
him, after she had explained carefully that his face had
flushed and that the tips of his ears were quite red—all
more or less comforting. In the give and take of
raillery that followed he almost recovered.</p>

<p>“The worst thing I have to contend with is this
engulfing shyness of mine,” he explained finally. “And
the worst symptom of shyness, perhaps you know, is
anger and sullenness. It knocks the speech out of me.
That makes me hot and angry. Then I’m apt to insult
my neighbour, and then it’s all off.... But I’m all
right now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she helped herself to a hot muffin; “you’ve
gone through all the phases, except that you <i>began</i> by
insulting your neighbour.”</p>

<p>“How, pray?”</p>

<p>He was quite unconscious of any guilt. She saw
that, so she preferred not to give her hand away by
explaining; yet, somehow, his half-joking reference to
her “charming village qualities” rankled. Her forebears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
had been York State farmers, then vineyard workers
and finally prosperous share-holders in the industry
of raising and marketing of grapes and grape products.
Although the present generation of children had gone
to boarding-school and to college, had travelled and
were accustomed to shop in New York city, yet the fine
touch of the open country had never left them. That
was their abiding charm, if they only knew it; it gave
them a heartiness and a frankness and an independence
of bearing and speech that marked them with distinction.
Occasionally, however, in some social grouping
of metropolitan dwellers they had been brought to feel
a lack and were on the alert to turn even gentle compliment
into ironic criticism. The young man with his
patronizing air should be punished.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she turned away his sincere questionings.
“If you aren’t aware of the insult, we’ll
forget it and call it bad manners. Bad manners are
nobody’s fault.” The English servant was approaching
with the meat course, so she added a gracious and
distinct “dearie.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” he grunted. “I detest that word. I’d
rather be called ‘birdie.’”</p>

<p>The luncheon was a ceremonious affair. “It is part
of the scenery,” the lady had remarked, “so why hurry
it just to gaze on other scenery?” Coffee was served
in the tiny balcony, by which time the Bay had put on
other and gayer apparel; so the view had to be examined
afresh. All of which took time. It was three o’clock
before the bills were called for.</p>

<p>Several times during the delicious loafing on the
balcony m’lady had examined her steamer-list and had
stared at the man as if to find his name written on his
forehead. He noted her interest, but claimed none for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
his own. “Look, my dear,” she would say, “at lazy
old Vesuvius; isn’t he a villainous old giant, dirty, evil
and full of cunning. I bet he is planning another blow-off.”
And he would reply without any “dear” at all,
not seeming to need that handle of a name to lift his
comments.</p>

<p>“Why do you wish to go to America?” she asked,
this being the nearest she ever came to breaking into
the mystery of their personal lives.</p>

<p>“It is my home,” he answered in some surprise.</p>

<p>“I thought you were English?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” he remembered. “I am an American, even
if I am half English. My mother was English, but
father was so colossally American that it swamped the
English strain.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather unusual, isn’t it?” she inquired.
“It is more often that American women marry
Englishmen.”</p>

<p>“Not at all; they’re more heavily advertised, that’s
all. English women are very often attracted by men
of the type of my father. There are many marriages
of that sort. And the English father is mighty happy
over it, I can tell you, for he gets off without the hint
of a dowry. No decent American would listen to the
suggestion of a dot, you know.”</p>

<p>There the subject dropped, and for a time all subjects.
In lazy silence they looked on the view and
thought their own thoughts.</p>

<p>Once he remarked, “I’m curious to know what that
English butler is doing in an Italian inn. He can’t be
happy outside of the West End. I wager he is hiding
from the police. He looks it.”</p>

<p>And she replied, “Have you no curiosity about
me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“Much,” he smiled. The word “much” had come
to have local significance.</p>

<p>“You don’t ask whether I am a baroness or a saleslady,
or Miss or Mrs.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to know.”</p>

<p>“Growing shy again?”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“Or is it just urban rudeness?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” he laughed as he comprehended. “No. No.
Not at all. I don’t want to know until I have to. I
prefer the mystery, that is all. If you wish I’ll tell you
who I am, but I hope you won’t wish, at least just at
present. We’ll be together two weeks on that boat.
They say ten days, but I know them. It’ll be a
fortnight. It’ll all come out there. Let’s enjoy
this thoroughly unusual companionship. It really is
ideal——” he went on enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she interrupted, though he hardly
noticed.</p>

<p>“—The sort of thing that ought to happen on this
earth every day. Human beings are utter strangers
to one another. It takes a shipwreck or a national
calamity to force them to acknowledge the existence of
the neighbour they prate so much about loving. Let’s
continue our primitive relationship. Call me Richard
if you wish. It’s a good name. And I’ll call you,” he
picked up the steamer-list and read a name, as he
thought at random, but a light underscoring had
unconsciously caught his eye.</p>

<p>The owner of that name had done what everyone
naturally does with a steamer-list or a programme or a
column of “those present,” glanced quickly at her own
name to discover if it had been printed correctly. It
is most annoying to have a “Mrs.” where a “Miss”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
should be. Then her nervous finger-nail had underscored
aimlessly, until the name fairly popped out of
the list.</p>

<p>“‘Miss Geraldine Wells,’” he read. “There! I’ll
call you ‘Jerry.’ Is it a go?”</p>

<p>Miss Geraldine Wells almost leaped in astonishment.
But his innocent face assured her. She looked aloft
critically, as if to judge if the name were worthy. The
butler arrived with a tray of change.</p>

<p>“Is it a go?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>“Please! Please!” he shook his head firmly.
“Please don’t do that.”</p>

<p>The butler was handed his tip and was waved away.</p>

<p>“Your ear-tips are beginning again,” she told him
in the tone she might have used to announce a spoon in
his coffee cup.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the butler was bowing and muttering half-coherent
“Thenk-you-m’lud’s.” His eye had taken on
a fine frenzy.</p>

<p>“That funny remark has cost you——” Richard
calculated aloud, “twenty lire is $3.86, and your share
is $1.93. It cost you just $1.93 in American money.
You got my mind so upset that I gave that idiot a
20-lira gold-piece too much. He’ll probably murder
us now for our money, or what is worse, scream the
news to the neighbourhood. We’ll have to pay high to
get out of this. By rights you ought to take the whole
cost.”</p>

<p>He rang the bell. The butler appeared.</p>

<p>“I made a mistake just now in giving you that 20-lira
coin. Oh, it’s all right! I’m not going to take it
back. I’ll be a good sport and pay for my blunder;
but I was careless, that’s all. The point is——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>The English serving man was rigid with fright.
Fees of any sort had been rare that season, and his
wages were negligible.</p>

<p>“The point is,” the half-Englishman spoke confidentially,
“I don’t want the whole establishment to think I
am a millionaire and stand in line to blackmail me when
I go out. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>The butler began to show signs of life.</p>

<p>“Puffectly, m’lud. I will take you hout myself, by
the rear terraces, m’lud, and nobuddy shall presume,
m’lud.”</p>

<p>And by the rear terraces they escaped, where the old
coachman and the “dinky” carriage were duly waiting.
A gold coin had done the work for him, too. He had
considered himself hired by the day. Rich brides and
grooms rarely came into his power.</p>

<p>“And where will M’sieu and Madame go now?
Pompeii, Vesuvius?” He named a list that would
have been the death of his cadaverous animal.</p>

<p>“Pompeii, of course,” agreed Miss Geraldine Wells.</p>

<p>“Do you think we have time?”</p>

<p>“Plenty.” She was stepping into the lurching
vehiculum. The driver was rattling forth soothing and
enticing Italian, which no one heeded.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know anything about trains,” he
persisted.</p>

<p>“Neither do I.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to miss our steamer.”</p>

<p>“Don’t we?” She was comfortably seated.</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, woman——”</p>

<p>“Jerry,” she corrected.</p>

<p>“—I was lucky to make that boat at Genoa. Had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
to ride fourth class from Munich. I can’t afford to
miss it now.”</p>

<p>“I can,” she tempted. He stared at her.</p>

<p>“Let’s,” she begged softly.</p>

<p>He appeared to be reflecting. In reality his mind
was standing still. The driver was in his box looking
at them with an ineffable sentimental smile. The rich
honeymooners would decide. He would wait. A
month’s salary in a bad season was his already.</p>

<p>“Get in, Richard,” she moved her skirts to make
room on the diminutive seat. “Be a good boy and
come along. I have money enough. We’ll take the
next steamer. They sail every Wednesday, don’t
they?”</p>

<p>He got in and the equipage swung off. On the way
down the hill they debated and forgot the view.</p>

<p>Pompeii was so many miles off there, he made it clear.
The present vehicle would get there some time, if the
horse and the wagon and the driver held together, but
not in time for the sailing of steamers. He would not
listen to her suggestion to hang the sailings of steamers
and be a good sporting Sir Richard and stay over for
the next boat, but drove doggedly on to convince her
that in the few hours that were left, their only resource
was a drive through the streets of Naples, an hour or
two at the Museo Borbonico, and an early dinner at
some hotel within hail of the ship.</p>

<p>Upon the subject of the Museo he grew suddenly
eloquent. It contained one of the most significant
collections of Roman remains in the world. The best
of Pompeii and Herculaneum was in reality in Naples
in the Museo. He seemed to know all about it, indeed,
as if he were himself a collector.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” she called softly, and held his arm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
She had interrupted a list of the things that made the
Museo unique as an omnium gatherum of Roman curios.
“You talk like a personally conducted tour. We’ll go
to that Museo right off. Tell the curio up front to
drive there when we get to the town. But, really, my
dear Richard, your interest in things stirs me. It is
the first flash of life you have displayed; and you saved
that up for a museum! I’d be afraid to see you get
really worked up over an Egyptian mummy or something
really dead-for-keeps. We’ll just have to stay
over and let you loose in that dear old Museo of
yours.”</p>

<p>He remained silent for a jolting minute or two.</p>

<p>“One of my reasons for coming to Naples,” he said
quite simply, “was to see the Museo Borbonico.”</p>

<p>For a moment she pondered in turn.</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t we go there this morning?”</p>

<p>“This is your excursion, not mine.”</p>

<p>“But we’re going shares on expenses, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“I hope so. I warned you that I don’t always pay
my debts. You wanted the hill and the view—so did
I; so did I, believe me; it was glorious—but I felt
under obligations to consider your wishes before my
own. And—well, I did not suspect at our first meeting—forgive
me!—that you would be—uh—up to
doing Pompeiian mosaics and Roman bronzes. You
are the sort who keep the best of their mind concealed
at first. You——”</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I pick you apart like this? It is an
absorbing interest of mine.”</p>

<p>“I rather like it. It’s like having your fortune told.
Go on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“You chatter at first, rather—well, too fluently,
perhaps; and in words and phrases of a language you
learned at about sixteen. Now I should say that you
were at least ten years older than that——”</p>

<p>“Nine.”</p>

<p>“Exactly; nine. Well, the girlish extravagant
language comes cropping out first, until you get
stimulated into thinking grown-up thoughts. Then
your very vocabulary changes. Your remark that
Whitman is super-moral, for instance, is a summing-up
of the man. No youngster could have gotten that
so neatly without——”</p>

<p>“Stuff!” she laughed. “I cribbed that for my
Woman’s Club essay. How <i>do</i> you suppose those club
essays are gotten up!”</p>

<p>“Of course you would affect modesty naturally;
although it’s a mistake. When you’ve done a good
thing you should own up. But all that’s neither here
nor there. If you hadn’t come along I’d made up my
mind to slip off the boat after luncheon—I couldn’t
afford to risk buying a meal; I’m so extravagant—and
do the Museo in time for the boat dinner at six. There!
I’ve been very frank. And, really, I don’t mind if we
cut the Museo out of the programme altogether. I have
no very deep desires for anything in this world. I’m a
terrific loafer.”</p>

<p>“Tell Louis Napoleon up there on the box to drive
to that Museo; I’m keen for it,” she commanded.</p>

<p>It was half-past four when they drove up to the door
of the museum. A clear sign announced that the institution
would close at seven o’clock. And at fifteen
minutes after seven o’clock, when they were finally
driven from the place, they had hardly advanced beyond
the first few rooms of that wonderful collection. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
almost eight o’clock before they found a suitable place
to dine.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a pity,” she said as they waited for the soup,
“to leave without seeing those other rooms!”</p>

<p>“Horrible!”</p>

<p>He stared at the full dining-room without seeing anyone.
“Horrible,” he repeated, but immediately plucked
up a cheerful spirit. “It is something saved for next
time.”</p>

<p>“When will that be?”</p>

<p>“I was seven years saving up for this trip—you see,
I can’t do a thing like this on a cheap scale—I mean I
haven’t the ability. Suppose we say 1919—that’s a
nice-sounding year.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>She was very sympathetic.</p>

<p>“Really,” he mocked her seriousness.</p>

<p>“And if we stayed over we could take a week to it.”</p>

<p>The dinner moved slowly. They were within a five-minutes’
drive of the steamer and the faithful Louis
Napoleon was outside on guard, but Richard kept his
watch before him. Meanwhile the lady aimed to prove
how easy it would be to miss the boat, have the ticket-money
refunded, and do the proper thing by the
Museo.</p>

<p>The idea grew in his own mind as the minutes ticked
nearer to the fateful nine o’clock.</p>

<p>“You could stay in one of those Woman’s League
<i>pensions</i>,” he mused, “while I lived at a nearby hotel.”</p>

<p>She baited him with alluring arguments, exactly in
keeping, he might have thought, with those village
qualities which, he had observed, were part of her
charm. Undoubtedly, he noted her seeming artlessness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>At eight and three-quarters he rose briskly, walked
to the curb, and openly paid and dismissed the faithful
coachman.</p>

<p>Nine rang from a dock-tower or two as he jubilantly
received coffee from the large silver-service at which
Miss Geraldine Wells presided.</p>

<p>“Jerry!” he cried joyfully. “It’s done. The
Rubicon is crossed and the Atlantic is not! We’ll
hunt up one of those Woman’s League places right
after dinner.”</p>

<p>“No,” she corrected; “not immediately. My conscience
is York State and peculiar. You’ll have to
drive me down to the boat-landing, so that I can
say truthfully that I went there, but it was too
late.”</p>

<p>“That <i>is</i> rural!” he laughed. “My conscience is
strictly urban, like a steel bridge; it’s built to stand
an awful strain.”</p>

<p>Jollity came out upon him. He grew witty, quick
of tongue, even appreciative of the woman before him.
He called her “Jerry” as if he liked the name; he did
not resent her occasional “my dear.” His vacation
had been suddenly lengthened; he was like a child in
his unaffected glee; while the lady grew demurer and
demurer, to use the language of “Wonderland.”</p>

<p>The rural conscience of Miss Geraldine Wells was
insistent. It demanded precedence over hunts for
Woman’s League <i>pensions</i>; and it would not walk, it
would go in a cab. What if the distance is short and
cabs cost money? Isn’t a satisfied conscience above
rubies?</p>

<p>Not that Mr. Richard objected to the most freakish
demands of Miss Geraldine’s York State conscience;
on the contrary, he was most interested in it; it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
one more curious phenomenon of the most curious of
all phenomena, namely Life itself. He dealt with it—on
the rumbling ride along the docks—both seriously
and humorously. In fact, he was in the midst of a
rather good joke on the moral iniquity of consciences
in general when the vehicle stopped abruptly near the
front end of a familiar black hulk on which a string of
striking white letters proclaimed, “S.S. <i>Victoria</i>.”</p>

<p>“Play’s over,” a laughing voice whispered in his ear.
“Wake up, child, and come on home.”</p>

<p>But he did not wake up. He stared stupidly and
tried to get his bearings.</p>

<p>“She sails to-morrow at six, Sir Richard,” the lady
explained, again demurely; “not to-night at nine as
you so foolishly believed.”</p>

<p>“You knew?” he inquired thoughtfully.</p>

<p>She laughed; a little uncomfortably, for he was
trying the operation of looking through her.</p>

<p>“Then you had no intention of staying over?”</p>

<p>He asked the question very mildly. It was quite
clear that he felt not a shade of anger at the elaborate
jest, but anyone could see that he was mightily
disappointed.</p>

<p>“Staying over?” she arched her brows. “Why,
Sir Richard! What a question! I am not <i>altogether</i>
rural!”</p>

<p>Then he woke up, paid the driver, and plodded with
her up the steep gang-plank.</p>

<p>Sir Richard was himself again; that is, silent and
benumbed. He stood solemnly beside her and stared
at the announcement on the bulletin-board that the
<i>Victoria</i> would sail “to-morrow morning at six.” Then
after a mere smiling nod for a good-night he wandered
down the corridor to his stateroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Miss Jerry Wells found a lonely steamer-chair on the
upper deck, tucked herself in with the help of a clumsy
deck-steward and tried to feel guiltless. The lady from
the country had had her revenge, but she did not feel
very happy over it.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>“SAW YUH!”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wells</span> had other reasons for feeling guilty.
Travelling about a foreign city with a man whose
name she did not know, suggesting to him the dare-devil
possibility of a week’s sight-seeing together,
decoying him into a genuinely excitable interest in
the scheme—he <i>had</i> been hard to work up to the due
pitch; and she had some pride in her art there—and
then snubbing him with the reality, these were not
the main causes of her uneasiness as she loafed in the
steamer-chair and listened very intently to the sound
of the voices as each new group of returning tourists
struggled up the gang-plank.</p>

<p>Of course she had never a thought of really slipping
off with this mild semi-English “Richard.” She would
not have dared. It gave her a shiver of joy and a shock
of fright to think of the thing: the blessed freedom, the
strong sense of being protected and catered to without
any sickening atmosphere of male—there is no word
for it, but she knew exactly what always disgusted
her finally in the best of men companions. A smirk
of the eye, a pretence at absorbing interest in the
lady’s welfare, a terrific deference to her whims and a
plashing of small talk aimed exactly to meet the
requirements of the small female mind; all that plus
a fluttering about which is so significantly—male.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>The worst of it was, she thought as she waited, the
environment of that sort of thing had had its frightful
effect upon her. She had developed a feminine helplessness
exactly in proportion as the masculine helpers
had pressed about her. To-day she had felt her lack
keenly. Her voice was high and over-confident. Her
talk flashed. She held to no topic, but darted here and
there. All this had been applauded for years. Men
had shown frank amusement at her sallies. They had
flattered her into a sense of security.... And they
felt no such thing. It was the male joke to treat women
like children, give in to them at every unimportant
point, offer them absolutely no resistance, so thereby
they should never grow. Men insult each other, argue,
deny, speak the truth, give the lie, and so thrive.
What man would give a woman the chance of growth
that lies in insult!</p>

<p>This Richard chap had told her quietly and frankly
that she had not let her mind develop, although he
assured her that it was struggling to express its native
maturity.</p>

<p>“Your mind is really grown up,” he had remarked,
after she had uttered a supposedly stinging bit of
cleverness, the sort that made other men laugh and
pretend fear. “Why don’t you hold your speech
back sometimes—that rattling, quick-fire, spoiled child’s
speech of yours? Alternate days of silence would give
your real self a chance; but you shout it down; you
talk it into helplessness. One of these days, if you
don’t look out, it will give up, and then you will be
like thousands of other women—horribly like.”</p>

<p>In revenge she spoke not a word for a full half-hour
as they watched the view from the balcony on the hill.
But he—good, unoffending soul!—had matched her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
with a sample of his own silence. And throughout the
interminable half-hour he had seemed to be unaware of
aught save the peace and serenity of the moment,
while she was torn with violent desire to break forth.
Before the time was up, her anger had cooled, she
noted; the hot, smart phrases appeared in review and
one by one were discarded as cheap; slowly the deep
calm of her latest self came near the surface; and
when she spoke finally it was not a pent-up burst of
words, but a quiet, sensible observation that surprised
even herself.</p>

<p>And then he had talked to her, the first time, it
seemed, as human adult to human adult. The defences
of sex were down and she enjoyed a new sensation.
Here was a man who conversed with her mind and not
with her eyes and her hair. It is difficult for a girl
with extraordinary good looks to get credit for sense.
Eyes and hair do intrude. They get on the spectator’s
mind. He feels that he must pay constant tribute
to them. Few suspected that to this striking young
woman the daily and hourly reference to her physical
charm had grown to be annoying. It was a relief to
discover a man who seemed to ignore it all.</p>

<p>The cause of her worry was not due to her pleasant
little adventure in Naples. By itself that was a charming
experience, but she knew it would not remain long
as an isolated fact. If she had been alone on this
homeward journey all would have been well, but she
was in the charge of a thoroughly efficient mother. At
any moment Mrs. Wells and her son, Walter, might
arrive with the small party that had banded together
to take advantage of the day in Naples.</p>

<p>Geraldine had pleaded fatigue and sea-sickness to
get rid of that “party,” especially of the university<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
instructor who had been piloting them about Europe
on a commission; but she had been frank to her mother.
The well-oiled voice of the university instructor, his
faithfulness, his carefully-studied facts had done their
full evil. The mother liked that sort of thing, or,
rather, she could use it and ignore it; but she quite
understood her daughter’s increasing repugnance to
the personally conducted tour and especially to the
personal conductor. “Oh, very well, my dear,” she
had smiled an easy agreement, “stay on board if you
can stand it. You have done your duty nobly so far.
We’ll give you a furlough. But it is likely to be my
last trip for many years, and I’m the sort of trotter
that must nose into every gallery. Mr. Freneau gets
on my nerves, too, sometimes. I quite understand.
Do just as you please.”</p>

<p>But Geraldine knew her mother well enough to be
certain that she would not be at all pleased with the
sort of “trotting” her daughter had done. With any
other man one could patch up an agreement of what
to say and what not to say. Without actually fibbing
one can conceal a powerful lot of objectionable truth.
“Richard” would not fib. She could fancy his mild,
detached stare at the suggestion of an illicit collusion
to deceive the mater.</p>

<p>Geraldine had almost dozed off in her chair when she
heard Mrs. Wells’ strong voice at the top of the gang-plank.
The softer tones of Mr. Freneau were not
distinguishable.</p>

<p>“Hel-lo!” Geraldine called, or rather sang, a sol-me
family signal.</p>

<p>The indefatigable mother—she was a woman of
imposing size, but agile—pushed along among the
darkened chairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Well, my girl,” she greeted cheerily, “how is the
head? Better?”</p>

<p>If it had not been so dark the mother’s appreciating
smile could have been observed.</p>

<p>“Head?” Geraldine was only half out of her nap.
It took the sweet smile of university instructor Freneau
shining behind a bracket-lamp to recall the voluble
excuses given that morning to account for Miss Wells’
stay at home.</p>

<p>“Surely,” the mother poked her jocosely, “you don’t
expect us to believe you were shamming just to get rid
of us—eh, Mr. Freneau?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Geraldine remembered. “<i>Much</i> better,
thank you, mother. Breakfast seemed to fix me up.
I’ve been feeling fine all day.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells dropped into a chair beside her daughter.
Mr. Freneau, hovering near, was dismissed with many
expressions of appreciation for his day’s work. The
son, Walter, an excessively thin, bent-over, boy-man,
sprawled in a chair. He seemed to be sleeping.
Presently the mother tapped him gently on the knee
and suggested that he go below and get some rest.</p>

<p>“All right, mother,” the boy spoke up suddenly.
In spite of his springy rise to his feet and his attempt
at an assured air, one could see at a glance that this
son was weak. His deep-set eyes roved restlessly, his
body swayed gently or became noticeably rigid, as if
a natural balance was an effort.</p>

<p>The mother watched him as he swayed along the
deck. He disappeared down a stairway with an extraordinary
clatter, as if he had fallen over the first few
steps.</p>

<p>“How has Walter been to-day?” Geraldine asked.
There was no solicitude in her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“I don’t like his looks lately,” Mrs. Wells replied
thoughtfully. “I think he is summoning up courage
to rebel, but I am too strong for him. My will has
the upper hand and that must be his will for a long
time to come. It was a mistake ever to send him to
that ‘cure.’ Firm kindness and the constant suggestion
of a right attitude towards life is what he needs.
This trip has proved it. Except for that outbreak in
London we have had weeks of peace. He is stronger,
he eats better and he is contented.”</p>

<p>“He seems to be terribly afraid of you.”</p>

<p>“I want him to be. But I don’t think it’s fear, my
dear. My stronger will has got hold of him, that is
all. He obeys——”</p>

<p>“Like a whipped puppy.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. That’s a good comparison, Geraldine.
He needs right habits the same as a good dog. They
must fear until the bad habit is driven out and the
good habit becomes natural. You don’t think I treat
him badly, do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. You are wonderful. You get results
which those people up at the ‘cure’ said they got by
knocking him down. I am only saying that he looks
defeated, beaten. Perhaps it is better that way. I am
sure it is more comfortable for us.”</p>

<p>“Decidedly!”</p>

<p>The two women thought of the horrible years when
this boy was growing from a tippler to a hardened
drinker. He had become an incurable alcoholic almost
before they realized that something must be done, something
besides scoldings and cutting off his spending
money and driving him out of the house to sleep at the
neighbours’ or in the barn or, worse, in the puddle at
the end of the front lawn. Some men drink heavily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
all their lives without reaching the condition of this
lad. He was twenty-two years old, but he had the
slight build of a sickly young boy.</p>

<p>“Did you find the steamer uncomfortably hot?”
the mother asked. The other topic was too distressing.</p>

<p>“No; I—I felt so much better that I took a little
stroll into the city.”</p>

<p>“Not alone, I hope? I don’t mind London, or
certain parts of Paris, but you know how I feel about
Italy, especially at the docks. You did not go
alone?”</p>

<p>“Mother! Of course not!”</p>

<p>“The steamer seemed deserted when we left. Who
went with you?”</p>

<p>“A friend of the Captain—he’s a very unusual——”</p>

<p>“He?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a friend of the Captain. The Captain told
him——”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the captain of this boat. I hope his
friends are less evil looking. What’s the name of this
friend of the Captain?”</p>

<p>Why can’t we have some sense of the future? All
day she had lived in the passing hour, and yet a single
thought ahead would have assured her that she would
have to meet this subtle, inevitable cross-examination
in the evening. Mrs. Wells never meant to be unkind
or domineering, but she was everlastingly on guard.
She permitted the largest kind of liberty, but she
always “wanted to know.” Concealment, subterfuge,
these were her enemies. It would have been so easy
for Geraldine to have discovered the man’s name. Of
course the mystery was charming; but at the dinner,
say, it would have been a simple matter to lean
forward and say, “This incognito is delightful, my dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Richard, but I have a most exacting, scrutinizing
mother who will demand precisely who you are. Now
let’s call the game off and tell each other our real
names.” She remembered now, that part of her own
game had been to conceal the existence of mother, to
play the part of independent young person. Otherwise
how could she have fooled him with that audacious
suggestion to stay over until the next steamer? And,
by the way, how did she ever get nerve enough to do
that! The thing did not seem bold in daylight; but
here on this gloomy deck with an alert and expectant
mother waiting for particulars it suddenly appeared
brazen.</p>

<p>“His name——” Geraldine yawned carefully and
at length to gain time. “A peculiar name”—yawn—“If
I had my steamer-list here I—ooh! I’m so sleepy.
It was”—yawn—“Richard”—yawn.</p>

<p>“Richard?” The mother turned the name over.
“That’s peculiar, for a surname, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Yes,”—Geraldine recovered. “We know a Mr.
Dick and a Mr. Richards, but Mr. Richard is singular.”</p>

<p>“Is that a grammatical joke, my dear?” the mother
asked.</p>

<p>“I”—yawn—“excuse me!—I don’t see any joke,
mother. Really, I must toddle off to bed.”</p>

<p>“Richards, of course, would be plural,” the persistent
mother followed. Her mind was never at rest.
“Do you mean that this Mr. Richard—without—the—‘s’
was really singular or just grammatically
singular?”</p>

<p>“Uh?” Geraldine turned a marvellous imitation
of a sleepy face. “I’m afraid I don’t see it, mother.
Forgive me for being so”—yawn—“dull. <i>Good-night!</i>
I’m off to Shut-eye town. Good-night!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>But the mother was not so easily shaken off. Mrs.
Wells was never fatigued. She required only five to
six hours’ sleep. At her home on the hills above Lake
Keuka she would play bridge until one o’clock and be
up at six to superintend the daily distribution of work
in the dairy.</p>

<p>“Mr. Freneau began to get on my nerves too, to-day,
Geraldine,” she pursued her way into her daughter’s
stateroom and disregarded yawns and sleepy disrobings.
“He is so patient,” she laughed, “and knows
his lessons so well. Of course he is absolutely indispensable
for trains, baggage, bills, ‘free days’ and so
on, and, as a rule, he is absolutely authoritative. He
digests all the books so impartially. But to-day I
began to feel the way you do always, repellent. I disputed
with him horribly. He was always right, but
that made no difference. I suppose it’s the end of the
trip. One does get filled up even with ideas and facts.
I couldn’t listen to-day. His information flowed over
me. He saw it, too. I fear I made him uncomfortable.
After all, I suppose he’s just as sick of us.
Fancy anybody giving up his time so devotedly. Did
you get to the National Museum?”</p>

<p>“No.” Geraldine was putting herself deliberately
to bed. Her mother had a species of clairvoyance that
inevitably sifted the thoughts out of one. The topic
must be kept off the Captain’s friend Mr. Richard until
some sort of conspiracy could be arranged. Scruples or
no scruples this man would have to do the right thing
and stand by a lady.</p>

<p>A list of the other stated attractions of Naples were
shot at the reclining figure.</p>

<p>No, these had not been visited.</p>

<p>“Then where on earth did you go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“The Museo Borbon—something or other. We—uh——” A
perfect imitation of a young woman falling
asleep in the middle of a sentence.</p>

<p>“Museo Borbonico? Why, my child, that’s the old
name for the National Museum. I <i>have</i> remembered
some of the things Mr. Freneau tried to put into my
head to-day. Did you see the bronzes, and the head
of Cicero, made probably from life?”</p>

<p>No answer from the berth.</p>

<p>“Are you asleep, Geraldine?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“H-m,” suspiciously. “Talking in your sleep, eh?
Well, I’ll not bore you further. That’s what’s making
you fat, so much sleep.” She looked about the room.
“You must stop eating chocolates, too. I believe they
are a sort of narcotic, if the truth were known. I
notice that fat, sleepy girls are pigs on chocolates.
Well, good-night. You can tell me about your trip
to-morrow. I’ll take a peep at Walter before I retire
to see if the absent treatment is working as usual. I
have a feeling that if he had not gone straight to bed
I should sense it somehow. Good-night.”</p>

<p>There was no response from Geraldine, so Mrs.
Wells put out the light, fixed the catch on the lock
and slipped quietly into the corridor.</p>

<p>Walter’s room was on the other side of the boat.
Geraldine gave her mother time to get to the end of
the corridor before she arose, snapped on the light and
donned shoes and a kimono and twisted her plaited
hair into a shape fit for public view. Then she sat on
the edge of the berth and pondered. To-morrow early
she would——</p>

<p>What was that? A fumbling of the catch of her
door and a hesitant knock. She knew that uneven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
touch. She drew the door partly open. In the
hall-way, shrinking far back, was Walter, grinning,
breathing long, deep breaths through his open mouth.</p>

<p>“What is it, Walter?” Geraldine asked. She was
firm with her question, as she knew she must be. A
touch of the pity she felt for him would have come
through her tone, he would have grasped at it and all
would be undone. “Mother said you were to go right
to bed, you know.”</p>

<p>The word mother shook him. He leaned forward
and looked up and down the corridor. Reassured, he
grinned again and nodded his head knowingly.</p>

<p>“Saw yuh!” he managed to gasp.</p>

<p>Geraldine understood without further words. Somewhere
on that trip with “Richard” Walter had spied
them. She knew, too, that the mother had not, and
that Walter was keeping the secret for purposes of his
own.</p>

<p>“Saw yuh!” he repeated, and wagged his head, a
grinning idiot.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Museum. Saw yuh goin’ in. We were goin’ out.”
Abruptly the boy grew mysterious. His lower jaw
shot up into the upper, his eyes popped and the
nostrils heaved with his heavy breathing. He wagged
a finger. “<i>I</i> fixed ’em. I pointed up street. I pointed
and said, ‘Looka that.’ An’ then you and him, you
went in.”</p>

<p>A startling smile illumined his face. His mouth
sprang open again. He leaned against the farther
wall and asked her as plainly as pantomime could,
“Now, wasn’t that clever of me? And what do you
suppose I’m going to get out of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Walter, Mr. Richard and I were in the Museum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
this afternoon. I told mother all about it. Now,
don’t you think you’d better run along? It’s late.”</p>

<p>He pondered on this unexpected turn of things.</p>

<p>“Mr. Richard,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Richard.”</p>

<p>“You told mother?” he inquired politely.</p>

<p>“Yes, Walter. Now run along, please.”</p>

<p>“An’ I don’t get my little whack out o’ this?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there’s nothing to whack, Walter.”</p>

<p>“Aw-ri’,” he stumbled off. “Aw-ri’.” And farther
down the corridor he summoned up a deep voice, the
one he used to have, in a thunderous “<i>Aw-ri’!</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Wells had been too wide awake to stay in her
room. It was only midnight. Walter could be looked
after later. She arranged herself in a more comfortable
attire, donned an easier pair of shoes and wandered to
the upper deck.</p>

<p>She had very many comforting thoughts as she reclined
and reviewed her European tour. Except for a
single outbreak at the beginning of the trip Walter
had been docile and willing. Her control of his mind,
she congratulated herself, was as simple as running an
electric runabout. She had always had a hypnotic influence
over her family, but never before had she known
its full power. Whatever she had set her mind to she
had achieved, and, she was glad to assure herself, the
reclaiming of her son was another victory.</p>

<p>To her intense astonishment her reverie was broken
by the appearance of Geraldine in slippers and a
kimono. To be sure the kimono was an elaborate
thing that might have passed as a gown, and the hair
had been wound around and around until it could pass
for being “up”; and the ship was not lighted as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
would be on the sea. But why should she be prowling
about—prowling was just the word—and so wide awake
after such a painful evidence of somnolency?
Could she be looking for her mother?—No. It was
a gentleman she nudged and awoke. Mrs. Wells heard
the apology and saw Geraldine move on and glance into
the face of another man who had found the deck
more comfortable than below stairs. Geraldine passed
quickly by and merged into a dark group of men
forward.</p>

<p>What sort of goings-on was this? Could Geraldine
be walking in her sleep? Mrs. Wells half arose as if
to follow, but decided that that was not in her rôle.
She would not spy; she would wait.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Geraldine had moved quietly from one
end of the boat to the other in the hope of finding
“Richard.” Ordinarily some sort of explanation could
satisfy the mother. There had been nothing extraordinary
in her little adventure; but the entrance of
Walter spelled trouble. He had a dramatic fashion of
causing trouble in unexpected ways. The mother’s
calm justice would be disturbed and injustice might
easily follow.</p>

<p>Geraldine reached the smoking-room, peered in at
the assembled card-players, but just a half-minute too
late. If her eyes could have distinguished a quarter
length of the deck, she would have observed the tall
figure of Richard moving towards bed.</p>

<p>So reluctantly she gave up and went below, promising
herself an early promenade and a careful look-out.</p>

<p>Loud voices in her corridor gave her a chill of apprehension.
Before her door she found her mother and
Walter. The boy was disgustingly drunk; and he
was ugly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Won’t be bossed any more!” he announced with
a string of dirty oaths. “I’m through!” he shouted,
“through with naggin’ and bein’ pushed into this and
into that.”</p>

<p>With the help of a steward they managed finally to
get him to bed in Geraldine’s room, Geraldine sharing
with her mother an adjoining compartment. Even
with the aid of the ship’s doctor and an able-bodied
steward the two women put in an awful night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>ORRIS ROOT AND CARBOLIC ACID</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> had the boy obtained money? And how
had he got it? Geraldine and Mrs. Wells knew his
former methods. The ordinary relaxed figure of the
boy suggested a mind without a scheme, but on the
trail of money he could summon wonderful powers of
cunning. Like a paranoiac under examination who is
quite aware of every symptom that might betray him,
and conceals them, Walter could temporarily throw off
the look of the idiot, the hanging jaw, the lurch. And
his begging stories were strikingly plausible.</p>

<p>Money had to be kept from him, of course, and also
any article of value—ring or watch. To give him so
much as a shilling would mean neat brandy and the
beginning of a debauch. That explains the presence of
so much money in the possession of Geraldine. She
was helping to guard it from Walter.</p>

<p>In London Walter had got a five-pound note from
the Bishop of Clewes. Mrs. Wells was taking advantage
of a letter of introduction for the sole purpose, as
she admitted to Geraldine, of comparing reality with
Trollope’s <i>Barchester Towers</i>. Having listened to a
conversation aimed to draw a contribution to the
Relic Society’s monument fund, Walter had deftly
taken the Bishop aside to announce that Mrs. Wells
wished to present five pounds to the secretary of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
society on her way to the station; that it was not wise
to let her interest cool until she went through all the
red-tape of banks in London; and that the safest thing
to do was to permit Walter to take the money, preferably
in gold, from the Bishop. Of course no trouble
of banks, etc., would keep Mrs. Wells from paying the
Bishop within the week.</p>

<p>The plot worked well in many ways. It gave the
Bishop a certain sense of actually contributing himself,
it forced Mrs. Wells to forward a P.O. order to the
Relic Society, and it gave Walter his chance for a
riotous rebellion.</p>

<p>Then the mother took command. Somehow, whether
it was hypnotic or not, Walter was unable again to
summon courage to beg, although he had many opportunities.
On the point of beginning a tale fear,
chattering fear, would seize his very voice and throttle
the story into extinction. For months he had lived his
daily animal round without once giving the suspicion
of an attempt to break away. Mother and daughter
had begun to feel secure.</p>

<p>And now it had happened again. Somewhere on
that steamer a passenger had been gulled into giving
money to a well-dressed tramp. Walter was no more
than that. Geraldine pondered over each name on the
steamer-list and came to a conclusion. Walter never
approached strangers. He hadn’t the courage to pose
on his own recommendation; his game was invariably
to strike the most recent acquaintance of one of the
family. There were many good reasons for this procedure,
one of which was the fact that everyone else had
been warned. On the list before her there were only
five names of possible persons whom Walter could
know, and all of these—except one—had been strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
enjoined from helping a wrecked boy to further ruin.
That one, “Mr. Richard,” she felt sure had been
the mark of Walter’s latest story. There was something
comical in the thought that to give money to
Walter Mr. Richard had been compelled to part with
his sole five-dollar bill.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells and Geraldine had been two days below
decks before Walter’s ugliness wore off into weak illness.
They had taken turns watching him and were
spent for sleep; so, naturally, they gave their first hours
of relief to bed. The steamer had passed Gibraltar
before either woman emerged to the upper deck. With
a steward on guard in the corridor—handsomely tipped
in advance and with the promise of a definite daily
wage—they came up one late afternoon in time to join
the deck promenade before dinner.</p>

<p>“Ah!” Mr. Richard popped suddenly out of a
steamer-chair. “I’ve been looking for you——” He
was about to say “Jerry,” when he caught both the
frightened look on Geraldine’s face and the imposing
figure of the mother. Then he swiftly changed to
“Miss——” but paused before the “Wells,” for to him
that was as much a pseudonym as “Richard.”</p>

<p>“I want you to know my mother,” Geraldine put in.
“This is the gentleman, mother, who was good enough
to play escort in Naples that hot day we were tied up
there.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Richard-without-the-‘s’?” Mrs. Wells inquired,
and then went on, “Mr. Richard, I am indebted
to you for looking out for my daughter.” She was
examining him with care. “She says you are a friend
of that villainous-looking Captain. I am glad to see
you such a peaceful-looking person. Please get back
into your comfortable steamer-chair. We have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
below deck ever since Naples and just must tramp a
little.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if you have been ill. The passage has
been remarkably smooth.”</p>

<p>“We have not been ill. I have a very sick boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry!”</p>

<p>“He is better now. Pray sit down, Mr. Richard-without-the-‘s,’
and do put on your cap. I appreciate
the deference to my grey hair, but I am also enough
of a grandmother not to want to be the cause of a cold
in the head. Later, I shall want to talk to you.
Good-bye, until we get on our feet.”</p>

<p>The incident of Mr. Richard, the Captain’s friend,
had been driven from Mrs. Wells’ mind by the catastrophe
to Walter. Now, as she walked arm in arm
with Geraldine, she began to piece things together.</p>

<p>“That night in Naples,” the mother began in a tone
that put Geraldine on guard.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p>“Why were you searching about the steamer only
half dressed?”</p>

<p>When Geraldine had confronted her mother and
Walter that night before her stateroom door, the
easiest explanation was that she could not sleep and
had been on deck to get the air. That excuse she had
carefully tucked away for later use. But the mother
did not ask, Why did you go on deck? but, Why
were you searching about the steamer? Mother’s
second-sight was uncanny.</p>

<p>“Were you looking for Walter?” Mrs. Wells
suggested.</p>

<p>“He had been acting queerly,” said Geraldine.
“He came to my room after you left.”</p>

<p>“Of course he did not get the money from you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>They rounded a corner, bent themselves to the strong
wind and turned for the trip back.</p>

<p>“There is something I want to ask you, Geraldine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother; what is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know myself. It is in the back of my head
somewhere; it’s an uncomfortable something-I-want-to-know,
but don’t know what it is. I trace it back
to a question I was about to ask you when Walter
began and blew everything else out of my head.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was my prowling about the boat?”</p>

<p>“No; I did want to ask about that, but that is
explained, and yet there is something else.... It will
come to me suddenly some day, and then if you are not
about I’ll write it down.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells was strong on Mind. Without being a
Christian Scientist or a clairvoyant or a Yogi disciple,
she was a little of all, including Swedenborgianism.
She claimed to be a free psychologist, interested in all
spiritual and mental phenomena but above a label.</p>

<p>“That’s most interesting, now—this concealed
thought in my mind. Think of it, my dear, it is up
there in my head hiding from consciousness! It was a
question—I am sure of that—but about what I can’t
guess.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was about Mr. Richard?”</p>

<p>Geraldine knew her mother. One might as well have
the thing out now rather than later. This was a good
safe time, while they walked alone.</p>

<p>“Yes!” Mrs. Wells called out triumphantly. “It
was! That’s a clue, at any rate. It was about Mr.
Richard and—wait!... And it was about your
kimono ... wait! Don’t speak for a minute.”</p>

<p>They walked along for the full minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“No,” the mother shook her head; “it poked its
head out; I almost put my hand on it, but it slipped
back again. It was about this Mr. Richard, and about
your kimono—oh, I can see your kimono plainly!—and
about your search on the deck for Walter. I can
see you bending over a man and saying something to
him. What made you ever suspect that man to be
Walter? Why, he had startling white shoes and
white trousers, a get-up that Walter detests.... Oh!
Wait!... No, it’s gone again. I thought I had it.”</p>

<p>Geraldine felt thankful that Mr. Richard had at
least two changes of raiment. On the day of her
adventure he had been attired in grey coat and white
shoes and trousers. That is why she thought she had
her man when she awoke the unknown sleeper on the
upper deck and inquired, “Is that you, Richard?”
“Is that you, Richard?” she had asked, she felt so
sure that she had the right man; and when he had
looked up with a “Eh, what?” the shadow of his cap
was so dark on his face that she did not see her mistake
until after she had said, “This is Jerry.” The man
had risen gallantly and came out into the light of an
oil-lamp. He was quite different from Richard now;
but when he saw the lady’s face he was eager to be
Richard or any other man the lady willed.</p>

<p>“Too excited over Walter, I suppose,” Mrs. Wells
answered her own question. “There! I won’t talk to
you any more. You look dead tired from these last
few days. You are not yourself at all, my dear. You
used to be such a chatterbox; now, you are becoming
actually—reserved and self-contained.”</p>

<p>They walked several deliberate steps before Geraldine
said pleasantly, “Do you think so, mother?”</p>

<p>“There!” the mother exclaimed good-humouredly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
“We walk five strides—plump! plump!”—and she
counted out five more heavy steps with a “plump!”
for each step—“before you say, ‘Do you think so,
mother?’ And now that I think of it, such a non-committal
phrase, ‘Do I think so?’ It throws the
whole thing back on me. It doesn’t admit anything.”
She squeezed her daughter’s arm affectionately. “Now
that’s fine, Geraldine. I hope it is permanent. There’s
no use giving yourself away by incessant chatter.
But, my lady, I’ll have to study you all over again.
This reserve and non-committalishness is very hard
to read. I used to be able to look into your mind
and see the gold-fish and count every one of them.
It <i>was</i> like a sweet little aquarium, my dear, the kind
with a tiny romantic castle—greatly exaggerated—at
the bottom. I’m glad that’s smashed. You got to
be too pure and easy. I was aching for something
harder, something——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells stopped her talk abruptly. They
walked on in silence, striding heavily to the heaving
deck.</p>

<p>“Something what, mother?”</p>

<p>“Well.” The mother was joyful. “That’s ten
‘plumps’ before I can get a word from you. I’ll have
to watch you, my dear. You are getting deep.”</p>

<p>Geraldine was elated that her keen mother had noted
the change in her. It was all she could do to restrain
herself from a voluble explanation. But here, fortunately,
was a case where explanations would not help.
She was practising her “latest self,” as Mr. Richard
had called it, and resolutely putting out the earlier
tenant, that fluent, superficial, aquarium child. So
she was restraining every impulse to speak, and when
speech was necessary she chose words deliberately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Already she had scored a fine point. As a rule she
was limp before her mother’s cross-examination, and
the reason she never knew until now: always she had
set the wheels of explanation flowing, sometimes without
an interval between the mother’s questions. On
two occasions lately when Mrs. Wells had shot her
questions, Geraldine, with a slightly nervous quaking,
had begun deliberately to count five before answering.
As a result Mrs. Wells had jumped into the vacuum
created by the silence, even before Geraldine had got
to three; and in each case Mrs. Wells herself had supplied
a satisfactory answer to her own question. <i>Q.</i>—“What
were you doing prowling about the deck that
night in Naples?” <i>A.</i>—“Looking for Walter, of
course.” <i>Q.</i>—“Why did you disturb a man dressed in
white?” <i>A.</i>—“You were so excited over Walter, of
course.”</p>

<p>Mr. Freneau, the university instructor guide, stopped
the walk for a moment to make his polite inquiries.
While Walter’s condition was being made clear to him,
Geraldine stepped back a few paces to “Mr. Richard’s”
chair.</p>

<p>“I must see you,” she said, “before you talk with
mother. Do you mind taking the name of Mr.
Richard? I fear I have blundered in trying to explain
our trip to mother.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he agreed good-naturedly. “It is a
good old name. Shall I think up a pleasant Christian
name to match it, or have you arranged that, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do. But please be careful. I see now how
rash and impulsive I was to go off with you. Can you
manage to be a friend of the Captain’s, too?”</p>

<p>“I’ll arrange that instantly. We have already
passed the time of day. Fortunately I did not give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
him my name. He’s the sort that doesn’t ask for
names. I know nobody on board. Except for your
absence I have had delightful days and nights of
hermitage. I’d make a first-rate Trappist. Since
Naples I have spoken barely a word to anyone except
the bathroom steward. Forgive me for being garrulous—I
am just stored up with conversation now.”</p>

<p>“Well, be careful what you say to mother. She
thinks we went to the Museum and came right back.
It would hurt her to feel that I had deceived her; and
I’m sorry now that I did. Is this your chair?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come up after dinner for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Good! I have a very interesting story to tell you.
It is about your namesake, Miss Geraldine Wells.”</p>

<p>“Save it. Mother is looking for me. I must go.
I’ll come up when I can get away. Wait for me.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, Madam.”</p>

<p>After dinner Mrs. Wells insisted on going on guard
to relieve the steward. Geraldine was, therefore, free
to go on deck. Mr. Richard had arranged two chairs
with rugs. It was a wonderful dark night.</p>

<p>“We have a little business to settle,” he began.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.” She remembered that they had gone
shares on the trip into Naples.</p>

<p>He produced her purse. She had forgotten all about
that. It was a wonder that Mrs. Wells had not asked
for it.</p>

<p>“Do you realize, imprudent lady,” he said, “that
you have turned over to a stranger—I am the stranger—the
equivalent of very nearly one hundred dollars in
gold?”</p>

<p>“Was it that much?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“No.”</p>

<p>“You tempt me to be dishonest,” he laughed.
“And it is a great temptation, too; for not only am
I broke, but I have lent some of your money to one of
the passengers here, and, bless me, he seems to have
fallen overboard. He hasn’t been in his room, the
bathroom steward tells me, and he hasn’t been at his
place at table.”</p>

<p>“How much was it?”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, but it was forty gold lire.
Most peculiar the way the thing happened. I was in
the smoker watching a mighty poor game of bridge
when I noticed a young chap beside me, odd sort of
fellow, well dressed and all that, but consumptive looking.
He was watching me with the strangest smile, as
if he had some joke on me. Well, he had! When he
caught my eye he leaned over and whispered, ‘Good-evening,
Mr. <i>Richard</i>.’ Then he winked and stuck out
his tongue in the drollest way. Of course I fancied
he knew you and had heard about our little fun over
names. ‘My name’s Wells,’ he said, and leaned far
back and nodded knowingly. ‘And my sister’s name
is Geraldine Wells.’</p>

<p>“We shook hands and I made some remark about
taking his sister’s name in vain. I explained how we
had picked a name at random, and asked him point-blank
how he had found us out, but he winked at
me and shook his head. ‘I’m no squealer,’ he said.
‘Mum—that’s <i>my</i> name,’ he said very mysteriously.
Well, I chatted with him for a while—he didn’t say
much himself; he appeared rather disturbed; kept asking
me what time it was and getting up and looking
out the door and coming back and shaking his head,
until I asked if there was any trouble. I’d be glad to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
make amends for picking his sister’s name out of the
catalogue and christening someone else with it.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ he smiled, very plaintively, I thought; there
was no trouble, only he wanted to go to bed and
couldn’t because the family luggage was tied up out
there on the wharf with a lot of cash due on it. Mrs.
Wells, his mother, was doing Naples and Pompeii and
had taken all the money with her. Of course the
trunks and things could wait until morning, but it was
rather dangerous to wait. The boat sailed pretty
promptly at six the next morning, you know.</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Good-night,’ and started out. I asked
him if five dollars would do. He wanted to know how
much that was in lire. When I told him he shook his
head and said he would camp on deck and wait up for
the mother. Forty lire was the amount due. I fumbled
in my pocket and fell on your purse. He refused to
take the money at first, but finally let me lend it to
him. Of course he’ll pay me, unless he got into trouble
on the dock and failed to sail with the steamer. But
wasn’t it strange about the name Wells, the one I
picked out from that steamer-list?”</p>

<p>“Walter Wells is my brother.”</p>

<p>“Eh? The chap who borrowed the money?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me that you are really Geraldine
Wells?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all occult happenings!”</p>

<p>She explained how the underscoring on the steamer-list
had attracted his eye and forced him unconsciously
to choose the name.</p>

<p>“And you knew all along?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly. Of course I know my own name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“But you said nothing, gave me no hint.... You
are deeper than you look. And say,” he recalled something;
“what an ass I was to tell you all that rot about
keeping silent and not blurting out all you know. And
by the way, Miss Jerry, you scored beautifully on that
stay-over-until-the-next-boat idea. I’ll wager you knew
all about that sailing hour.”</p>

<p>She smiled mysteriously.</p>

<p>“I admit nothing,” she said. “I’m complimented
enough to know that you thought me game enough to
do it.”</p>

<p>“Never thought of you at all,” he remarked frankly.
“Should have, of course. I was thinking of myself
solely. Dreadfully selfish, eh? I am an egoist, not
an altruist at all.... But it would have been
jolly.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>He laughed intimately. “We have a lot of personal
vocabulary between us, haven’t we? ‘Thank you,’
‘much,’ and——”</p>

<p>“And ‘my dear.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Yes; yes. That little family luncheon-party
with our own butler was charming, now, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Your ear-tips are reddening, Richard, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Stuff,” he returned. “You can’t see them in this
darkness.... Now, why did you suggest the plagued
thing! They are beginning to burn like fury. Odd
about those ears; they give me credit for modesty
and honesty and a lot of virtues. Blushing is just a
disease of the circulation, like pallor. Criminals blush
as often, I suppose, as——”</p>

<p>“Richard!”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Why do you let speech blur the finer self, deep-hidden
and begging for expression?”</p>

<p>“Very good! Very good!” he cried; “a hit! Do
you know, Miss Jerry, I am having an extraordinary
rush of conversation. I haven’t talked so much since
I don’t know when. But here goes. Shop closed.”</p>

<p>For a minute or two they rocked gently with the
steamer and cultivated the “unexpressed self.”</p>

<p>“Oh, see here!” he was the first to speak. “I can’t
stop now. There is much to settle up yet.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t attempt to settle money matters on
this boat,” she interrupted. “I don’t see now how you
can ever pay me back without mother knowing; and I
won’t have that now. Forget about it. You can pay
in many other ways.”</p>

<p>Again they had a minute or two of silence.</p>

<p>“But there’s something else,” Mr. Richard insisted.
“Where is this Walter brother of yours who took the—oh,
I beg your pardon; he is the sick one, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is he better?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He got the luggage from the dock all right, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>Geraldine counted five before replying and then five
more. He had better know the truth.</p>

<p>“There was no luggage on the dock.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Our trunks and bags were taken on at Genoa and
are all packed in the hold or in our staterooms. Walter
was working you for money. He saw us together in
the Naples Museum and was trying to blackmail us,
that is all.”</p>

<p>He said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Geraldine sketched briefly the story of this youthful
derelict and of their seeming control of him lately. She
told how their only safety was in keeping money from
him, how they had warned everybody and how the
mother had believed she had broken down his very will
to beg. Then she gave Richard the result of the interview
in the hall; and the frightful outbreak and their
days of struggle with a drink-crazed man.</p>

<p>“My refusal to pay up,” she said, “stirred his
courage, I suppose. It angered him into action. He
went straight to you.”</p>

<p>“And I gave him money,” Richard spoke thoughtfully,
“the money that sent him down and out. That
makes me responsible.”</p>

<p>“You did not know,” Geraldine excused him.</p>

<p>“Responsible none the less,” Richard insisted quietly.
“You surely don’t believe that the events of this world
depend on whether folks know or are sorry or even wish
otherwise? I gave that boy the money that sent him
back to the devil. Knowing or not knowing has nothing
to do with the fact. I feel responsible and I’ll make
what amends I can.”</p>

<p>“You can do nothing with Walter. Everybody has
given him up. And it is such a pity. He’s really a
nice gentle boy who has been poisoned, that’s all....
But he is frightful when the devil gets working in him.
Mother isn’t afraid of him, but I am. You can do
nothing; nobody can.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” said Richard. “I am terrifically strong.
I can lift and pull and knock things about in a quite
extraordinary manner. That gives me confidence.
This drink business is largely mental. I’ve done a
little mental-suggesting, out of curiosity merely. Let
me have a try at the boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“If you talk that way,” she laughed as she left him
to take her turn below, “you and mother will get along
famously, and she’ll believe anything you tell her.
Mental is mother’s favourite word. With mother
everything is mental.”</p>

<p>“Everything is,” he assured her solemnly. “Even
you, now, charming as you are, even you are only a
figment of my brain, a well-ordered complication of my
optic nerve. See! I can close my eyes so—and poof!
you vanish. To me you are a very pleasant dream.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“And for me you would not exist at all,” he went on,
“if I ceased to hear you, see you, touch you, taste you
and—I haven’t tasted you yet, but I would know your
scent in the dark.”</p>

<p>“How dreadful!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! No; no!” he sniffed the air delicately.
“It is a faint orris and carbolic acid. Very pleasant,
really; and perfectly antiseptic. You probably use
an orris perfume. I don’t know what the carbolic is.
All existence is sensation and I am an epicure on the
cultivation of the senses. I am right about the scents,
am I not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite right,” she laughed. “Carbolic soap is
one of mother’s manias. Keep up that pose and mother
will love you!”</p>

<small>THE CARD ON THE DOOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> time came when Walter, a very sick boy, could
be brought up on deck and cared for. It is so easy to
account for any sort of secret illness on shipboard that
few except casual inquiries were made. The ship’s
doctor, a good old fellow using the trip as a vacation
from regular practice, knew exactly what to do.
Unknown to the mother Walter received his daily
tipple, only a touch, to be sure, but enough to prevent
the complete horrors of unrequited thirst. The grateful
Walter lay on his chair disturbing nobody, and, in
his weak way, lived. Mr. Richard and the doctor had
good chats together, all of which were stored up by the
layman for future use.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells and Mr. Richard fell into each other’s
arms, figuratively, at the first encounter. Geraldine
sewed tranquilly and listened to the contributions to
the thesis of the ultimate spirituality of all material
things, with side excursions on telepathy, hypnotism
and dreams. When Geraldine later had twitted Mr.
Richard (whose given name, by the way, they could not
agree upon, she claiming it should be something simple
and easy to remember like Robert or John, and he
sticking up for a distinctive cognomen like Llewellyn
or Gladstone)—when she had jested over his fine acting
with the mater he had looked at her with his mildly-serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
gaze. “I could not do that,” he had said,
“not with your mother. I am a Platonist, I suppose.
This world, to me, is a beautiful illusion of the senses,
a weak copy of the eternal verities. Your mother is a
very remarkable woman. I could not fool her long on
her favourite theme. No; we’re in deadly earnest—both
of us!”</p>

<p>In the middle of one of their discussions on the
mystery of mind Mrs. Wells suddenly turned to
Geraldine and cried excitedly, “I have it, my dear; I
have it!”</p>

<p>Geraldine sewed on and waited. The mother struck
an attitude of deep concentration. Somehow Geraldine
felt apprehensive. No member of the family had ever
attempted a prolonged practical joke on Mrs. Wells.
She had plenty of good humour but no appreciation of
fooling directed against herself. Therefore the palming
off of a stranger under an assumed name had grown
to be a burden to Geraldine, especially dangerous now
that Mrs. Wells had received the said stranger into the
intimate purlieus of her pet theories. One could not
play jestingly with Mind! Geraldine was particularly
anxious on this afternoon because Mr. Richard had
appeared in grey coat and white trousers, white hose
and shoes.</p>

<p>“Do you believe, Mr. Richard,” asked Mrs. Wells,
her eyes firmly fixed on his white trousers, “that conversation
can be heard by the subliminal self and be
transferred later to consciousness?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed,” Mr. Richard assured her. “That
is a very common experience. Half our requests to
repeat are not due to bad hearing. Our hearing is
well-nigh infallible, like any other recording machine.
Consciousness has been busy with something else, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
is all. Give it time and it will get the message. When
anyone asks me, ‘What did you say?’ I always wait a
second or two. Quite often my remark doesn’t need to
be repeated; he picks it up out of sub-consciousness,
where it has been perfectly printed.”</p>

<p>“The white trousers bring it all back,” announced
Mrs. Wells solemnly.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I see the upper deck very plainly.” Mrs. Wells
closed her eyes. Geraldine moved to a seat back of
her mother, from which safe position she raised a warning
finger to Mr. Richard. “Don’t fidget, Geraldine;
I must concentrate.... Geraldine is in a kimono; her
hair braided and wound around; she leans over a man
in white trousers and she says, ‘Is that you, Richard?’
and adds, ‘This is Jerry.’ He says he is not Richard.
Geraldine apologizes and moves away. The white
trousers stare after her.”</p>

<p>“Very rude of the white trousers, I am sure,”
Geraldine remarks, but offers no further help to clear
up a situation she remembers only too well.</p>

<p>“That is what I wanted to ask you about, Geraldine,”—the
mother ignored the comment—she had
probably only heard it with her subliminal ear, “but
Walter,” she glanced towards the boy who appeared to
be sleeping, “but Walter upset my mind completely.
Now, Mr. Richard, I did not hear a word of that conversation
at first, because it took all my mind to get to
the fact that Geraldine, whom I had just left sleeping
in her room, should be prowling about the deck nudging
sleeping men. It was not until Geraldine had moved
completely away that I caught up the words. When
she spoke I heard only a murmur, absolutely nothing
distinct; and yet it must have been recorded on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
subliminal and lifted later into consciousness. I was
going straight to Geraldine to ask her about her strange
conduct and particularly to inquire why she should be
asking about a ‘Richard’ whom she knew well enough
to permit calling her ‘Jerry’—why, bless my soul,
Geraldine was looking for you, Mr. Richard! But she
did not say <i>Mr.</i> Richard—I am sure of that; and she
<i>did</i> say ‘Jerry.’ Geraldine, help us out.”</p>

<p>“It’s too deep for me,” Geraldine smiled into her
sewing. “You two work it out,” she added serenely;
“one of the party ought to keep sane.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Mrs. Wells was always irritated at the
suggestion of any connection between mental mysteries
and loss of mental balance; but it drove her away from
Geraldine—as Geraldine intended—and set her questioning
Mr. Richard.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it is possible that I heard
correctly?” she asked Mr. Richard.</p>

<p>He pondered over the situation. The events of the
night came before him. Suddenly he remembered that
Geraldine had told him that she had sought for him
after Walter had visited her room with suggestions of
exposure.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he concluded suddenly; “I believe you heard
accurately, Mrs. Wells.”</p>

<p>Geraldine looked at him carefully. He gave her an
assuring nod.</p>

<p>“Miss Wells was hunting for Walter,” he said.
“She told me later. She thought she had discovered
me in the white-trousered sleeper and sought a helper.”</p>

<p>“But she called you Richard, as if you were a butler
or a chauffeur, and she presumed that you would know
her as ‘Jerry.’”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Mr. Richard laughed, “didn’t you know that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
my first name is Richard, too? Don’t blame me!” he
spread his hands out and shook his head. “Richard
Richard, that’s the label they gave me.”</p>

<p>“Why, no one would ever——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they would. Look at Jerome K. Jerome.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so.”</p>

<p>“And Peter Peter,” Geraldine helped.</p>

<p>“What!” the mother turned on her. She knew of
no Peter Peter.</p>

<p>“The pumpkin eater,” explained Geraldine as she
thoughtfully threaded a needle.</p>

<p>Richard Richard bubbled with mirth. He had a
hearty out-of-doors laugh. “Great character, old
Peter Peter. He and I have many qualities in common.
He was always hard up. So was his cousin, Tom
Tom.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” Mrs. Wells’ mind could not catch up
quickly with the jest. “Tom Tom?”</p>

<p>“The piper’s son, you know,” Richard explained.
“He stole a pig,” he added instructively.</p>

<p>“To be sure. To be sure,” Mrs. Wells admitted.
“How stupid of me.” But her intent eye showed that
her mind was still on the mystery. “There is no Mr.
Richard Richard on the steamer-list. I am sure I
should have noticed it.”</p>

<p>“No,” Richard answered slowly. “No-o. It
wouldn’t be. I came in late at Genoa. Didn’t make
reservations. Knew there’d be plenty of room in July;
all the rush the other way, you know. So they didn’t
get my name in time to print.”</p>

<p>Richard seemed to be enjoying the game. Every
now and then he would look towards Geraldine for
approval, but she gave him only a calm wide-eyed survey.</p>

<p>With cap drawn down almost over his eyes, Walter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
stretched out in his chair, was observing the group with
ferret-like eagerness. He knew a thing or two! They
were not pulling the wool over his eyes. And he would
show them, too; but in his own time.</p>

<p>The mother was not satisfied. “It sounds plausible,”
she admitted grudgingly. “Although how any sane
person would name a child Richard Richard——” She
interrupted herself to gaze firmly into his honest, genial
face. The absence of all guile assured her. Besides,
here was a man who really knew mental phenomena,
had taken courses under James and Münsterberg; had
some hypnotic abilities himself; was familiar with what
was to her an unknown region, Kant and Hegel; a man,
in other words, who had the right attitude towards
Mind. Yes; he was all right.</p>

<p>Then a horrid doubt assailed her, for she remembered
vividly that Geraldine had said to White Trousers,
“This is Jerry.” An hour or two of strolling about
Naples would not bring them to first names.</p>

<p>“But,” she began, and stopped.</p>

<p>“Wait, Mrs. Wells,” Richard sat up. “Do not
speak. I am about to try a bit of mind-reading. You
are wondering why your daughter should have called
me Richard——”</p>

<p>“And why she should have presumed you would know
her as Jerry.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells had taken the mind-reading as a matter
of course.</p>

<p>“Exactly.” Richard was quite ready with an explanation.
“You see, my peculiar name struck Jerry—struck
Miss Wells as absurd; which of course it is.
She said she could not call me Mr. Richard, as if she
were talking about me to one of the maids—‘Mr.
Richard will have his tea now; Mr. Richard does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
go out to-day’—and all that sort of thing. She said,
and wisely, that Mr. Richard was not, strictly speaking,
a name at all; so she said——”</p>

<p>This story was not going as well as it should. In
the flash of planning it had seemed a first-rate
explanation.</p>

<p>“What was it you said?” he appealed to Geraldine.</p>

<p>She counted her five before looking up from the
sewing.</p>

<p>“You seem to be doing very well,” she commented
quietly. “Go on. I’m quite sure I don’t remember
what I said.”</p>

<p>“You said something, I’m sure,” Richard cocked his
head sideways and tried to think of something she might
have said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells was thinking, too. “If Geraldine made
up her mind to call you by your first name she would
not be a daughter of mine if she hesitated. I agree with
her; Mr. Richard is uncomfortable; I think I shall drop
the ‘Mr.’ too.”</p>

<p>“By all means, do!”</p>

<p>Richard was glad to get out of the difficulty due
to the failure of invention.</p>

<p>“And I won’t press you,” said Mrs. Wells, her fine
face lighting up wonderfully, “to make up any more
ingenious stories of how two young people off on a
lark manage to call each other by their first names.”</p>

<p>Richard laughed. “It was embarrassing,” he admitted.
“One drops into first names, sometimes,
you know—uh—so easily and—uh—the explanation is
deuced hard to make—uh—in public.”</p>

<p>“I’m an old woman——”</p>

<p>“Oh, tut, tut; not at all.”</p>

<p>“But I am not so old that I can’t understand young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
folks. And anyway, young man, you are not built to
lie—your ears give you away.”</p>

<p>Geraldine broke forth in sudden merriment.</p>

<p>“Oh, see here!” Richard expostulated. “See
here!” The large lobes of his ears were burning.
“You’ll get me all fussed up if you draw attention——”</p>

<p>“The whole ear”—Geraldine spoke a word or two
between attempts to suppress her glee—“is crimson—and
now—the back of your neck is on fire!”</p>

<p>In the joyfulness of the moment Walter slipped carefully
from his chair and sauntered off; but he had not
gone far before Mrs. Wells’ watchful mind—the subliminal,
probably—had noted his absence. Without a
word she rose and trailed the boy. At the top of the
stairs he looked back, turned about sullenly and waited
for her.</p>

<p>“How did I do?” Richard asked earnestly, the
moment they were alone. He was as eager as a boy.
Although Geraldine was a strikingly handsome young
woman Richard paid no attention to that. In her
presence he was like a near-sighted man intent on his
own ideas. Just now he was openly delighted with his
own cleverness and appealed to her as co-conspirator
to give him full credit.</p>

<p>“You’re a better liar than I thought,” she gave her
judgment composedly.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” he shuddered at the word. “‘Liar’ is
pretty stiff, don’t you think? That’s a fighting word,
you know. Now, I should not call it lying, but diplomacy.
Same thing, of course, but—uh—quite different,
you know.</p>

<p>“But I say,” he bethought himself; “what’d you
think of my blushes, eh? Pretty clever, that. Gets
you credit for a deal of innocence. I——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“You surely don’t give yourself credit for the
blushes?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You can’t turn it on or off like a faucet.”</p>

<p>“But I can,” he insisted. “Been practising for
years. Found it very useful when caught with the
goods on.”</p>

<p>She looked at him thoughtfully; he grinned back and
nodded his head. As she gazed steadily at him the tips
of his ears began again, and slowly the flood welled as
before.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are giving me an illustration now?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Am I reddening up again?”</p>

<p>“You are—gloriously.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you say!”</p>

<p>“The deuce I say.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all—but it only shows how expert I am.”</p>

<p>“You turned this one on, too; did you?”</p>

<p>“Did it a-purpose; just to show you I could, you
know.”</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a better—fibber than I thought,” she
announced.</p>

<p>From the stairway Walter’s high-pitched voice made
itself heard above the ship noises.</p>

<p>“I’m done with you; d’y’ hear!” He was levelling
a very bony finger at his mother. “No more! No
more! I won’t let you get <i>my</i> goat no more. No, sir!
No, sir! Talk all you want! Oh, I’ll look at you.”</p>

<p>She had been quietly asking him to look at her in the
hope that with her eye upon him he would wilt as
before.</p>

<p>“I’m lookin’ at you! I’m lookin’!” he shouted
menacingly. “An’ what good’s it doin’ yuh? I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
got your number, O.K., and it’s <i>all off</i>! <i>All off</i>, I tell
you!”</p>

<p>Evidently she had asked him to let her go with him
to his room.</p>

<p>“No!” he raised his voice a half-notch higher. A
passenger here and there looked up. “You don’t
follow me about any more, you don’t. I’m on to you,
I am. No more! That’s—final.”</p>

<p>She kept steadily at him.</p>

<p>“Stop it!” he shrieked and began to sway back and
forth, “stop it or—or—or I’ll throw myself overboard.
I will! Do you hear? I will! Aw!” he
whimpered piteously, “can’t you shut up!”</p>

<p>Suddenly he darted towards the side and began frantically
to put a leg over the swaying rail. A passenger
struggled with him and delayed his attempt, which gave
Mrs. Wells time to reach him. She put out a hand
towards his shoulder; he struck her savagely. Other
passengers including Richard and Geraldine soon surrounded
the frantic boy and tried to calm him, but
certain unsuspected depths of passion had come to the
surface and gave him strength. His eye never left his
mother. He seemed anxious not to avoid her, but to
fight it out then and there for the mastery of himself,
or rather, for his freedom from the mother’s superior
will.</p>

<p>The blow had staggered her. He saw her falter and
knew his chance. He fairly crowed his announcements
that she would no longer settle on him and drive him
here and there like a puppy. In spite of her magnificent
appearance Mrs. Wells was no longer young. She
was sixty and she had driven herself hard. The sudden
fright at the boy’s jump to the railing and the
unexpectedness of the blow, to say nothing of the power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
of the sickening thought that her own boy should
offer to strike her in public, had its effect. An unusual
weakness caught her limbs, and her heart lunged
forward.</p>

<p>Summoning her will she presented a semblance of
poise and dignity. To the group about her she explained
that her boy was ill. He interrupted constantly.
She asked the passengers to let her manage. She knew
how. He would go to his room and she would go along
and reason with him.</p>

<p>All of this he denied shrilly; and in her heart she
knew she had lost her grip, as he cried aloud his victory.
No! No! He would never again go with her.</p>

<p>“Will you go with me?” Richard asked mildly.
“Let’s get out of this, old fellow, and talk it over. No
use letting this gaping crowd know our business, eh?
What d’y’ say?”</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll go with you,” Walter nodded seriously,
but there was no giving in in tone or manner. It
suited him to go with Richard. He told everyone that
it did. Richard and he were pals, he told them. They
had things, they had, to talk over and come to terms on.
Secrets, ha! Secrets that would make ’em all sit up
and listen.</p>

<p>Richard agreed and led him away. As they went
down the stairs, Walter leading eagerly, Richard cast
one look back. Pity for the old grey woman, looking
greyer now than ever, struck him hard. He pressed
his lips together and wished he could requite in some
measure the evil done her late years by this hopeless
boy.</p>

<p>The hopeless boy turned suddenly in the hall.</p>

<p>“Richard Richard!” he cried and laughed. “That’s
a good ’un. Richard—hell! I know you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Of course you do. Of course you do,” Richard
agreed. “But don’t bark it out to the whole ship.
Come along to my room and talk it over.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Walter assented. He said “Aw ri’.”
One would think by his speech that he was still
“not himself,” as the Welsh have it. No doubt the
passengers agreed upon that theory. But Walter’s
speech, drunk or sober, had become blurred and
difficult.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “I’m no squealer. I only
want my rights. That’s all.... Knew yuh wasn’t
no Mr. Richard. Knew from the first.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” Richard mused aloud as they walked with
difficulty along the swaying corridors. “How did you
get on to it, old fellow?”</p>

<p>“Saw your name on the door. Card.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you did!”</p>

<p>“Yes, thass-ri’,” Walter chuckled. “Saw yuh go in.
Looked at the door. Saw your name plain as writin’.
The card said——”</p>

<p>“<i>S-sh!</i>” Richard silenced him so thoroughly as to
frighten the boy. “Never mind what the card said.
Where do you think you are?” he demanded roughly;
“alone in the ocean?”</p>

<p>Richard put on his fiercest face. Walter had a
secret: very well; it should have value. “You’re a fine
pal,” Richard growled, “a devil of a fine pal.” He
strode forward with an excellent assumption of ferocity.
“Hang that card!” he added, merely to give verisimilitude,
as Pooh-Bah would say, to an otherwise bald and
innocuous situation.</p>

<p>That card was a mistake. He had put it up to
make certain that his luggage would reach the room
promptly, and with no thought of its being a permanent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
name-plate. When he reached his door with Walter he
wrenched it off impatiently.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he changed his tone. “Come in, old
chap. Let’s talk things over. Have something to
drink.”</p>

<p>Richard unscrewed a flask and poured out a good-sized
“slug.”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” he warned. “You’re in a bad way,
man, and I’m not going to have you kicking completely
over. I’m good for a drink now and then, but you
can’t swim in it.”</p>

<p>Walter drank eagerly. It seemed to set him up
almost instantly. Some of the fight went out of him.</p>

<p>“You’re all right,” he commented sagely. “A wise
guy, you are. And so am I, all right.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are.”</p>

<p>“And I’m no squealer, either.”</p>

<p>“Of course you aren’t.”</p>

<p>“You can be Mr. Richard Richard if you want—or
anything. Mum’s me! But in my opinion you ain’t
either one.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Yuh ain’t Richard and yuh ain’t——”</p>

<p>“<i>S-sh!</i>” Richard glared ferociously.</p>

<p>“Well—you ain’t. That guy,” he pointed towards
the spot where the card had been, “I’ve seen his picture
in the papers, and he’s an old man, old man with
whiskers, he is.”</p>

<p>A look of pain shot across Richard’s face. He
turned away and looked steadily for some time out of
the open port-hole. Then he came gently to the
stricken boy and said:</p>

<p>“Walter, let’s be friends, you and me. You’re
right about both names. That man,” his voice caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
as he pointed towards the door, “I’m not fit to walk in
his footsteps, much less bear his name.... There’s
nothing wrong about me, Walter. I want you to take
my word for that.”</p>

<p>“Sure there ain’t. An’ there ain’t nothin’ wrong
’bout me, either.”</p>

<p>“Of course there isn’t. That’s why I am going to
stand by you and keep you from jail.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“That forty lire you got from me for the luggage
which was supposed to be on the wharf. That’s what
they call obtaining money under false pretences. Good
for five years, I think.”</p>

<p>He gave the boy time to get the thought.</p>

<p>“Jail’s not half bad,” Richard looked up reminiscently
as if he was speaking from experience. “They
give you good grub and work enough to keep you feeling
right and sleep enough—<i>that’s</i> all right. But—there’s
not a drop to drink. Not—a—drop. Days
go, and nights go—nights when you stay awake hour
after hour with your tongue as hot and dry as a burnt
stick, and you cry out for a little cooling drink,
and all you get is a blow on the head. And the
days pass and the nights pass; and when you begin
to count up the months and maybe years yet to
come——”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. Walter was holding his
head in his hands. The picture was too much for
him.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Richard soothingly, “you needn’t
worry about me, Walter. I wouldn’t send a dog to a
place like that—not unless I were forced.... I have
my own reasons for being Mr. Richard. I’m going to
trust you to forget all about that card. You keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
that a dead secret, old chap, and I’ll stand by you to
the last ditch. Is it a go?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” nodded Walter, but the brag had gone out
of his voice.</p>

<p>They shook hands on it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>ASSISTANT WIDOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Richard’s suggestion Walter moved into the
older man’s stateroom. There the two men spent
many hours together. Walter was glad enough not
to have to appear among the others, and Richard
wished to study the boy. It was not entirely a
humanitarian interest. Here was a mental puzzle to
study out, and just at the time when such studies were
being made in the treatment of neurotics. Certain midnight
talks with a good chum in the faculty of Columbia
University were remembered; a lot of desultory
reading of the Freudians came rushing into memory;
and Roman bronzes fell to the background.</p>

<p>Walter’s antipathy to the mother underwent no
change, except perhaps to increase in intensity. It
hurt her pride to have to give up her position of influence
and she did not do so without a struggle.</p>

<p>No one else save Richard, or perhaps a professor of
the science of mind, could have talked with her on the
science of abdication. As delicately as needful, for
she had not yet recovered from the shock of Walter’s
sudden attack, he made clear the psychological necessity
of resigning if only temporarily.</p>

<p>“You arouse opposition. You make him strong to
oppose you,” he said to her one late afternoon as they
chatted on the upper deck. “No one knows why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
these mental storms arise, but it is always wise to guard
against stirring them up. He is in earnest about doing
away with himself if you try to control him again. He
and I have talked it over and on that one point he is
unshaken. You must frankly face the fact that your
boy is a neurotic. Back of that is always the danger
of self-destruction if thwarted. Fortunately, there is
the possibility of sudden cure. In fact, there is more
hope nowadays for mental ills than for physical ones.
You can’t grow a new leg or a new lung, but you can
completely remake the mind. Of course I don’t have
to tell all this to you.”</p>

<p>“Are you a psychologist?” she asked. “I have
never thought to ask about your occupation.”</p>

<p>“I?” he laughed. “Oh, no; not at all. I’m not
anything.”</p>

<p>“You talk so well on so many subjects,” she speculated,
“ceramics, Roman bronzes, psychology——”</p>

<p>“I’m a potterer,” he explained. “I just dabble here
and there. One year I’m daft on old printing, or the
growing of white blackberries, or multiple personality—oh,
I’m jack of a dozen things. But I have one real
accomplishment. I kept at it once until I could read
an Assyrian cuneiform brick in the Metropolitan
Museum! There’s an untranslated Assyrian dream-book
in the British Museum that I am just itching to
get at.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you just try a thing for a while
and——”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. I keep a great number of things
going. For instance, I’m tremendously interested in
primitive religions, Shinto and ghost dances and sun
worshippers and all that sort of thing; but I don’t keep
at it all the time. I drop one interest and take up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
another; give them each a turn. Just now I’ve grown
interested in your boy, but that’s an old interest: I’ve
been thrown a lot with twisted-minded people, over in
the West Side, New York, where I often live. There’s
a little settlement of social workers, Legal Aid Society
folks, socialists, new poets—oh, a delightful group.
That district has some pretty odd cases, too; and I’ve
been up all night with some of them.”</p>

<p>“And you have no regular occupation?”</p>

<p>“No; nothing regular, unless——” he laughed at a
thought that occurred to him. “You see, I’ve a pack
of awfully good friends who have money and homes and
all that sort of thing. When I get hard up—as I am
just now; I’ve only five dollars to my name—I pay
them a visit. I go only to places where they understand
me and let me alone. So I suppose I might call
myself—uh—a professional guest. I pay visits for
my board and keep.”</p>

<p>“You’re not a sick man?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no! I’m terribly healthy. I’ve played football,
rowed in a crew, polo, and I can swim a dozen
miles. I’m so strong I’m ashamed of myself.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you work?”</p>

<p>“I wonder what you mean by work?” he asked
mildly. He had long ago ceased to resent this inevitable
question. Here was a man without funds who got
along with the least amount of “work.” He explained.
“By work I suppose you mean making something to
sell. I’ve no objection to that, for those who can do it
and like it. The mass of people are working in that
sense. Of course it’s necessary, but the most of them
look pretty down-trodden and driven, don’t you think?
It’s a slave’s life for most earth dwellers. Some of them
never see sunlight: they drive away at some monotonous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
task under gas-jets or arc-lights; they burrow in wet
mines; they count up endless figures with green shades
over their eyes; they shovel endless tons of coal, mix
endless puddles of mortar or teach endless classes of
somebody else’s endless children. I can’t do any of
those things. For me it would be imprisonment, stifling,
maddening. I must follow my will and, unfortunately
or fortunately, my will does not lead on to fortune.
Happiness is my goal, personal happiness; and
in a very large measure I get it. Work? All my work
is play and I play hard. You don’t know what hours
it took me to get enough information together to read
that Assyrian brick! I lived for weeks on bread and
tea and an occasional chop cooked on Father Maloney’s
cook-stove over in the West Side.”</p>

<p>“But somebody had to pay for the chop and the
bread and the tea.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; that’s true,” he seemed to recollect that
his story did not fit together. “Oh, I work, too, in
your sense, to get enough funds together to do my own
kind of work. I’ve wired houses, fixed up leaky roofs,
cut grass on the big lawns—I’ve never had the least
trouble in selling my muscles—but my real job when I
get down and out and don’t feel quite like playing up
my professional guest business—I had almost forgotten
my best money-maker!—I’m an assistant widow.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that good! Assistant widow, and you don’t
know the business at all, do you? Oh, it’s profitable—I
make several hundred dollars in a few weeks—it’s
terrible drudgery, but it’s short and swift and soon
over. At Harvard college a ‘widow’ is a professional
tutor,” he explained. “There’s a famous one at Cambridge
whose business it is to put fellows through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
examinations with the least amount of effort on the
part of the student. Not a bad idea, eh? It’s a rather
sorry trade, I must admit, but it is very humanitarian.
Old ‘Widow’ Knowells always has work for me whenever
I want it at the time of the hour examinations and
at midyears and at finals. He gives me careful notes
of all the professor has done during the term, synopses
of outside reading, etc., and I’m an expert in bottling
it up. I can almost guarantee to put a fellow through,
if he has enough memory to last him over night!
Philosophy’s my stunt. I boil it down—from Thales
to William James—and make it palatable for the unphilosophic
mind. I’ve had as many as two hundred
men in one group for a three-night cram before the
exam. Rather horrid; isn’t it? But Knowells charged
’em five dollars apiece, and he generously gave me three.
That was my banner group. I made $600, enough to
keep me a year and save something towards this trip.
But it took me a month to get the taste of the thing out
of my mouth. Work? Ugh!”</p>

<p>American-bound steamers in July carry few passengers,
so Mrs. Wells had been able to reserve a fine corner
of the deck for her group, which now invariably included
Richard. At this moment as they talked Walter
lounged in his chair near the railing while Geraldine and
two middle-aged ladies who had been with the Freneau
party, and Mr. Freneau himself, were chatting quite
near. Geraldine leaned forward.</p>

<p>“Excuse me for listening,” she said. “Richard
tells such interesting stories.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is all true, every bit,” he told her.</p>

<p>“I don’t object to its being untrue,” she rejoined;
“the only objection to bad fiction is dulness. This
story of yours is not at all dull. What I want to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
is what would happen to the world if everybody did as
you. The stokers, for instance, live like condemned
devils. Don’t tell me they like it. But if they obeyed
their own sweet will where should we be?”</p>

<p>“And that chap putting tar on the ropes,” he
pointed; “I’ll wager he’d throw that job for a couple
of good sovereigns.”</p>

<p>“Of course he would,” she went on. “What I want
to know is how you manage to take care of the disagreeable
jobs.”</p>

<p>“Very simple,” he said; “I don’t manage at all.
I am not my brother’s keeper. My interest is solely in
steering myself. I have no theory for the other fellow;
I have only pity.”</p>

<p>“How cruelly selfish.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” he spoke quietly. “The cruelty of
living is the most colossal mystery of creation. I don’t
pretend to understand it, and I know of no remedy for
it. The struggle for existence is the acme of cruelty
until you renounce it, as I do. I live my life as simply
as I can. I try not to interfere with anyone else’s
chance. That’s all I can do.”</p>

<p>“What about the future?” the mother asked.
“You will not always be strong.”</p>

<p>“I take no thought for the morrow,” he said simply.
“I live entirely in the present. Who can take thought
and prosper? Happiness is not to be saved, put in a
bank. I live contentedly from day to day. When I
cannot do that—well, the remedy then is equally simple,
quietly end it.”</p>

<p>“Rather gruesome,” Geraldine shivered.</p>

<p>“Death is not gruesome to me,” he said. “I am
very sensitive of the shortness of life and of the inevitableness
of death. Most of us ignore the topic; but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
is constantly in my thoughts, as it was in Socrates’.
That’s the way to rid yourself of fear of the sure end;
face it; every morning smile in your glass and say,
‘Thou shalt surely die.’ Then all the world spreads
happily before you as a garden of delights, and the
pettiness fades and all the discords of smallness....
Well! well! I grow poetic—as I should. It is the
most magnificent event in life; the very thought of it
blesses the present hour.”</p>

<p>The steamship <i>Victoria</i> was moving through the
placidest of twilight seas. The setting is very important
to have in mind: the soft blur of blue on the horizons,
the high-banked clouds fringed delicately by an unseen
sun, the pure transparent grey of the zenith, and
the cool, salt breeze. Some themes cannot be set in
midday, nor amid the turmoil of business. A thousand
miles from land with only the frailest tie to existence,
poised in the centre of tranquillity, there without
mockery one could speak of death, of man’s mortality.
Here, if ever, was Death’s sanctuary, where one could
perform fittingly the ceremonies of awe and praise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells spoke first. “How old are you,
Richard?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Thirty-three.”</p>

<p>“You have the thoughts that usually come with
old age.... Are you a nihilist or—anarchist—or
something?”</p>

<p>“I dislike labels,” he said, “but why shouldn’t I be
called Christian? I take no thought for the morrow
and I would do unto my neighbour as I would that he
should do unto me—I let him alone.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that just the opposite of Christian?” Geraldine
asked. “Christians are rather aggressive; aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed, “the altruists are. Now I’m an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
egoist. I always felt that Christ preached personal
purity and renunciation of the world’s goods. If each
person were pure in heart and covetous of no man’s
goods, why, the millennium would appear.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand your egoism,” said Geraldine.
“I always thought altruism was undisputed.”</p>

<p>“My altruism is universal egoism,” he said. “If
each person on this ship were trained to take perfect
care of himself there’d be no need of a sacrifice in case
of shipwreck.”</p>

<p>Mr. Freneau drew his chair nearer. He had been
neglected pretty thoroughly by Mrs. and Miss Wells,
and he did not particularly object. It was a tiresome
job to pilot four women and a vagrant man through the
cathedrals and art galleries of Europe. Mr. Richard
was a welcome assistant, who had suddenly relieved the
tension and had given the guide a needed rest. As the
journey neared its end he began to recover and, humanly
enough, had a desire to talk and be heard.</p>

<p>“That’s very well put, Mr. Richard,” he nodded
approval. “We’re all selfish naturally, and it’s a really
decent creed; only everybody calls it bad names but
goes on practising it just the same. But isn’t it often
cruel? The essence of Christianity, I take it, is
sympathy, brotherly love. Egoism, as you call it, fights
all that, doesn’t it? It is isolated.”</p>

<p>The other two ladies drew into the circle. Richard
became silent.</p>

<p>“I’m asking you, Mr. Richard,” Mr. Freneau inflated
his lungs and began a dissertation in ethics. At the
end he appealed to Richard for confirmation of his
analysis.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry,” Richard arose and worried
through his excuses. “I have no doubt you are quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
right. I have never studied such things. I only know
my own life and I know very little about that. I have
no really fixed opinions on anything. Who could have?
But, excuse me, I must go. Walter and I are playing
a most exciting tournament of cribbage. Hey, Walt,
old chap; what d’y’ say? Another bout, eh?”</p>

<p>Walter sprang to attention eagerly. He understood
the code. It meant cribbage, of which he was desperately
fond—Richard had found that out early—but
it meant also a gill of precious cognac.</p>

<p>“Sure!” he said, and dragged himself out of his
chair and followed.</p>

<p>Mr. Freneau talked on, but his argument smelled of
the recitation-room. It was as far from life and living
as a college debate. Mrs. Wells watched her boy as he
went off so willingly with Richard, and wondered, a
little enviously, what charm the piper played. As
they made their way forward in the dusk she heard her
boy laugh at a remark of Richard’s, the first laugh from
him in many a day.</p>

<p>Geraldine found it too dark for sewing, so rested her
hands in her lap and looked out to sea. Before the
interruption the conversation between the three had
been quiet and intimate. She felt that they were just
about to approach interesting and novel things, revelations
about the common modes of thinking that would
illuminate them for ever. It was not a doctrine of cruelty
and selfishness that Richard was presenting, and in no
sense had he the attributes of a doctrinaire. As he
talked his face had taken on a wistful inquiry as if
he were in the act of coming to curious conclusions,
he knew not what. “Life is a strange land,” he had said
to her once in talking about Walter; “I always act
towards it like a voyageur floating down an unknown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
river. At any turn may be a peaceful lake, a wonderful
vista, an enemy in waiting or a dangerous waterfall.
It is folly to predict too much on the sole basis of
the journey done. And it is all wonderful to the curious
minded, even the enemy in waiting—if you approach
him right he may turn out to be a friend!”</p>

<p>Neither Geraldine nor Mrs. Wells was listening to
the eloquent Freneau.</p>

<p>“I am sure you have a thought on that point, Mrs.
Wells,” Mr. Freneau leaned forward expectantly. This
was the proper professional attitude to quicken interest
among wandering students. “Do let us share it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will,” Mrs. Wells arose. She got up carefully
and breathed deeply to steady herself, for she
wished to conceal the fact that Walter had struck her
a hard blow. Her pride would never have owned to
it, but it took serious attention on her part to rise and
walk without a show of stiffness. “Well, I will,” she
spoke firmly: “I have been thinking very, very deeply
on a matter that worries me much as I get nearer home.
I’m thinking exactly what I shall do to George Alexander
if he hasn’t weeded my hardy perennials exactly according
to directions. If he has permitted those sweet-williams
and Michaelmas daisies to monopolize the
whole patch at the expense of those delicate larkspurs,
I’ll—I’ll—probably take away his corn pone for a
month.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>GETTING WARM!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, in Richard’s stateroom Walter had
had his gill and was fighting hard at cribbage to count
in a fine handful of “fifteen’s.” “Pretty smart,” Richard
remarked as he drew a card. “Now why did you let
me have that eight spot?”</p>

<p>“Knew the five was under it,” Walter grinned and
rolled out his tongue foolishly.</p>

<p>“How did you know that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know the cards all right. And I know you
got two eights and a seven which you aren’t goin’ to
count in.... I need that five to make a ‘fifteen-two.’”</p>

<p>Walter made good his boast in one or two swift plays
that ended the game in his favour.</p>

<p>“Well!” Richard affected great astonishment.
“You peg out. I always thought cribbage was a game
of pure chance. You certainly can spiel ’em. Let’s
have another.”</p>

<p>As they drew and played and pegged Richard asked
questions. Sometimes he got the answers he wanted;
at other times a series of stealthy probes into the boy’s
past brought nothing. Finally he struck a vein that
brought the result he was after.</p>

<p>“What did you most like to do when you were a
kid?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Fish, mostly; and climb trees. Wanted to be a
sailor.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you?”</p>

<p>He darkened and twisted his face ferociously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know,” Richard soothed. The mother had
said no, of course.</p>

<p>“And wouldn’t she let you fish, either?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t kick again’ fishin’. Always glad to get
my trout.”</p>

<p>“Ah! She wouldn’t let you climb trees, I bet.”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Ah! I thought so! Still like to climb ’em?”</p>

<p>Again no answer.</p>

<p>“Play the game!” muttered Walter savagely.
“Play the game!”</p>

<p>They played, but Richard could hardly see the cards
before him. He made many bad mistakes. Once he
really forgot himself, and began to peg in fifteen-two’s;
but he caught himself in time and let Walter finally peg
out a winner of every contest. But his mind was not
on that game; it was excitedly going over the ground
of some interesting data that his friend in the Columbia
faculty, Professor Galloway, had produced in one of
their all-night chats on things mental. And here, if
everything turned out well, was a parallel case in
Walter.</p>

<p>Galloway was telling how the psychologists were
turning into veritable wizards and healers. Beginning
the study of abnormalities for the impartial purposes
of science they had to do with all sorts of freak cases
of mental derangement. Naturally the patients and
their friends were more interested in cures than in the
progress of science in the dim regions of psychology;
and naturally, too, the investigator found his fame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
depending more upon a sensational cure than upon the
discovery of psychic law. They had been forced into
the practice of psychology; and with hypnotism, “suggestion,”
dream readings and casting out of inimical
“personalities” their trade began to take on the
character of the ancient soothsayer and witch-doctor.</p>

<p>Galloway had been telling Richard of certain sudden
and unexpected “cures.” In one case, a “dope fiend,”
emaciated and degenerate looking, had abruptly
changed not only his mental personality, but had become
physically transformed. Growth began in him like a
garden after a drought. Healthy flesh multiplied on
his brittle limbs, his back straightened, his eye took on
intelligence. As if a bolt had been released that chained
his real self he cast off the Mr. Hyde and became an
uncontaminated Dr. Jekyll. Through accident they
learned that a nervous mother some years before had
peremptorily refused to let him run an automobile.
There had been many violent scenes; the mother had
become hysterical; the father, to keep the peace, joined
with the mother. Seemingly the boy had acquiesced,
but soon after, he had slipped many moral stages, until
a bad crowd and cocaine had got him. To the normal
mind it would be ridiculous to find a cause for moral
degeneracy in so simple a matter as the repression of a
strong desire to run a car; but the psychologist knows
the wisdom of readiness to believe anything. They got
the boy a car; they let him run it, take it apart, rebuild
it; they even permitted him to let her out a peg in the
open country and paid his fine for speeding. And—a
miracle—the long-suppressed spirit rose and took
possession and six years of vile living were cleaned out
as if they had not been.</p>

<p>It was this case that Richard had strongly in mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
when he took up an interest in Walter. It was a
chance, he thought, but worth trying for; so he began
from the start to probe. Tree climbing had come into
the conversation several times before. Richard fell
upon it as a clue; but Walter was wary. Like all
neurotics he fought away from the cause of his trouble.
When pressed directly he always denied any interest in
the thing; but Richard had found him watching the men
in the crow’s nest; and when he talked about the trip
at all it was about the height of the masts, and how
fine it would be to crawl up there on the rope-ladder
and fix the top lights. He was obviously disappointed
when told that the lights were probably electric and were
turned off and on by a switch in the engine-room.</p>

<p>Cases of thwarted will are engaging the attention of
mind students nowadays. A youngster will grow
physically ill, resisting diagnoses and medicines, and
all because a dollar watch is denied, or because someone
says no to a request for a pink dress. Most of us,
fortunately, fall in easily with the pressure of convention.
We are the lucky normal children; the ones who
thrive under opposition and make the rules for the
unlucky others.</p>

<p>When Richard asked Geraldine if she knew about
Walter’s desire to climb trees, she could not recall anything
of value. The mother on her part said he had
never expressed a desire to do such a thing. “He
climb a tree?” the energetic mother had ejaculated;
“he was always too lazy. What nonsense is this he
has been telling you?”</p>

<p>But while Richard was disappointed he felt it unwise
to press the mother for further information. He tried
once to hint of the newer development of body cure via
the release of mental suppression, but, interested as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
was in mental phenomena, she would not connect anything
of the sort with Walter. “He has had every
freedom a boy could desire,” she had said firmly; “he
has had too much. What he needs is a strong, resolute
hand.”</p>

<p>Geraldine, however, was taken with Richard’s point
of view and set herself to help.</p>

<p>“Let me ask you questions,” Richard said. They
had gone off together to the mass of machinery at the
stern of the boat. “Don’t mind how silly they may
seem. Galloway told me you can’t ignore anything.
He did a fine stroke once on a half-witted kid by noticing
the way she pulled at one ear. It’s a good story,
but I won’t tell you now. What I want from you
is a list of the things that Walter has been forbidden
to do. I know your mother well enough to see how
she would take mighty good care of her son and
heir; and her plan would be to make fast rules. Am
I right?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” Geraldine replied thoughtfully,
“she was most indulgent. Everyone says that she
gave him too much leeway, and she feels very conscience-stricken
over it now. That’s why she is trying to make
up by extra vigilance. I’m the one she always held in
check, but I never objected seriously; mother was
usually very sensible in her exactions.”</p>

<p>“Is there any other member of the family who may
have coerced him?”</p>

<p>“No; father died when we were very young. Mother
has managed the household ever since I can remember.
She was firm in small matters; but she was always kind
and reasonable. That’s why,” she hesitated and then
went on, “that’s why we always feel so dreadful when
we deceive her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>For a moment he gazed in his mild way far out
to sea, at the great churned path made by the
vessel.</p>

<p>“You begin to make me feel guilty, now; an experience
I very seldom have,” he said finally.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t your fault.”</p>

<p>Without being specific each knew that the reference
was to the day in Naples.</p>

<p>“Why should it be anybody’s fault?” he asked. “I
don’t believe in ‘faults.’ If you are a true Whitmanite
there is no blame. One might as well feel guilty over
cold and heat as over the acts of our nature. There’s
Whitman and Spinoza rolled into one! I don’t feel
conscience-stricken because my diaphragm moves up
and down or because my appendix is inflamed; why
should I be concerned, then, if my will takes its next
appointed step and attempts to go off with you and
your purse?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why,” she spoke after a moment’s
thought. “It’s my training, I suppose. But let us
get back to Walter.... The only time that I remember
when mother seriously attempted to control Walter
was several years ago when she scolded him in public
for something he had done in one of the sailing races.
He sulked around the house for days afterward, and he
never would go in the races again, although I am sure
he was awfully keen for them.”</p>

<p>“Jove!” Richard was suddenly eager. “We’re
getting warm. When was that—the exact date?”</p>

<p>“I can find out. I don’t know exactly; but it was
the year the <i>Tecumseh</i> won the cup. Every other boat
was either wrecked or blown ashore or filled with water.
Walter was helping sail the <i>Tecumseh</i>. He can’t swim,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“What was the thing he did that made your mother
scold him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember. Possibly I can find out. My
feeling is it was something to do with the spinnaker.
He used to be very clever at getting it out in just the
right minute when we came about and went before the
wind. But I can’t recall. All that I know is that a
terrific blow came up and sent those boats on end. It
ripped the masts out of two of them; and the <i>Tecumseh</i>
was so sprung she never was the same boat again. I
was time-keeper, I remember, and I know they did the
twelve-knot course in less than an hour. It was a
record, I think.”</p>

<p>“That’s fast sailing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you should see those ‘Class A’ boats.
They’re the fastest sailing boats built. I’m not boasting.
They’re scows, you know—centre-board—and
they just slide over the water. We took the inter-lake
cup the next year. You must come up and have a go
at it. It is fascinating sport.”</p>

<p>“I think I shall.” He spoke as if he had already
made up his mind.</p>

<p>“Mother is going to ask you to pay us a visit—as
a ‘professional guest.’”</p>

<p>“Fine!” he laughed.</p>

<p>“I believe you planned to have her ask you.”</p>

<p>If you had told Richard that he had planned to
forge a cheque he would have considered the matter with
an open mind and have rendered an impartial decision.</p>

<p>“Quite possibly,” he admitted, “although I am not
at all conscious of doing it. I thought I had intended
to visit a good friend in Montclair. In fact, I wrote
to him yesterday; but all the same I may have been
planning to go with you. I want to go with you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
That’s a very important clue. Trust your desires every
time; they tell which way the mental wind blows.”</p>

<p>“What could be your motive, then——” she began.</p>

<p>He interrupted. “Motive? I have no motives,
no conscious ones. I don’t know why I do things.
That’s what makes me such an interesting phenomenon
to myself. I unfold like a plant; and it’s very exciting—I
am always eager to know whether I’m going
to blossom into a sunflower or an apple tree or a wild
strawberry bloom.”</p>

<p>“Or poison ivy,” she interrupted.</p>

<p>“Quite so!” he agreed heartily. “Motive? I’ve
long ago given up trying to discover my motive for
anything. And, by the way, we’re usually wrong
when we do discover. Listen to the bragging of folks
around you, to their cock-sureness in knowing why
they do this and that. Sometimes the holiest of men
have the unholiest of motives, and many a rascal would
be surprised to know how really Christian he has been
acting. It is the same with nations and elephants and
earthworms. Life will have its way whether we understand
it or not. All that I know about myself just now
is that I very much desire to go to your Penn Ying——”</p>

<p>“Penn Yan, please,” she corrected.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how curious I am,” he looked at
her frankly, “to see what will happen next.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I want you to come,” she
answered thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I am hoping you will go quietly away altogether
after we land. If you come up to Keuka, sooner or
later, mother will know you are not Mr. Richard
and—it is a small matter, but I know her: she will not
think it small. It will strike her like a blow ... and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
she is getting old. She tries to conceal it, but I know.
The whole family have sat back and let her carry the
burden, but it has always been done so well that we
never inquired.... I’m just beginning to see what it
has meant to her. At ‘Red Jacket’——”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“We call our place ‘Red Jacket’ after a local
Indian chief. ‘Red Jacket’ is really a huge plantation.
We have farm land, vineyards, gardens—wonderful
gardens!—and a big household. She manages every
inch of it and has always done so. It’s beginning to tell
on her now.... She wouldn’t understand our studied
deception. It would break her; I’m sure it would.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” he agreed. “All right.” Silently
they watched the swirling water. “Walter interests
me,” he explained, “interests me more than you can
guess, but I can give him up.... Well, we’ve got a
day or two left. Let’s make the best of it. The boy
stirs me like the answer to a hard puzzle. I’m built that
way. I throw my whole life into the next thing that
attracts my curious mind.... To be honest, I’m afraid I
don’t care anything for the boy. Does that seem brutal?”</p>

<p>“No; I understand. You are like a surgeon performing
a fine operation.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I think I’m on the way to fix that boy
up! Really! I’m tremendously excited about it....
By the way, wasn’t there something in that yacht race
about climbing—I mean in the thing that Walter did
that set the mater off?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes!” she exclaimed, catching some of his
excitement. “I remember now. He went aloft to disentangle
the peak halyard. That’s it! Mother was
watching the race with a glass, and she nearly fainted
when she saw him leg up. She knew he couldn’t swim.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
The boat was scudding down the Lake with the wind
back of her; he did that leg in less than a minute and
she was heeling over nearly to the water. And Captain
Tyler said that that’s what won the cup, Walter’s
shinning up the mast.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” Richard seized her hand and wrung it
fervently. “We’re getting warm, Jerry! We’re getting
warm! That’s what he meant by climbing trees——”</p>

<p>“Of course!” Jerry was equally excited. “When
he couldn’t——”</p>

<p>“You have it!” he broke in. “When he couldn’t
climb masts, he sulked and wouldn’t race at all. Then
he went off and climbed trees all by his little lonely——”</p>

<p>“Just to show her that he wasn’t going to be
bossed!” she helped quickly.</p>

<p>“Sure! Then he got taking a drink or two just
for company——”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he ever really liked the stuff. None
of us do.”</p>

<p>“Of course he doesn’t. If his primary interest is
drink,” Richard flung up his hands, “the Lord help
him, for nobody else can. That’s what Galloway says.
I’ll get in touch with Galloway soon as we land.
Perhaps I can get him to come up with us——”</p>

<p>“Where?” She was sobered suddenly.</p>

<p>“To ‘Red Jacket,’ of course.” He laughed at her
stupidity. Her expression puzzled him for a moment.
“Or is it ‘Yellow Jacket’? I’m no good on names.
Well, never mind the colour, old girl. We’ll all work
on it and we’ll bring that kid around as sound as buckwheat.
Aren’t you excited about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered quietly. With her head resting
in her hands, she was frowning at the great swirl of
water left by the receding boat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>“MAN OVERBOARD!”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor “Jawn” Galloway</span> was of a different
“caste” from Richard, but they matched up equally as
chums. Galloway had been one of the West Side
group; in fact, he had been a West-sider from birth,
one of those clever Irish lads who can rise to distinction
out of the soddenest of homes. Dan Galloway, the
father, was a hearty, noisy—and it must be admitted—dirty
Tammany helper. Dublin had brought him
forth and he had seen troublous times there. A
lucky immigration and a still luckier political situation
saved him the trouble of working and gave him
lodgings, beer and victuals. “Jawn” Galloway, the
son, inherited nearly every trait of his father save two—he
was the farthest removed from a loafer; and he hated
uncleanliness. By the dint of sheerest personal push he
had gone through school, college and university and
was making a name for himself in the newest of callings,
psychotherapeutics. At twenty-eight he held honorary
doctorates from honourable universities; but to look at
his rubicund Irish face, to hear his laughter and to see
his joy over the coarser delights of life, one would never
guess all that.</p>

<p>As the S.S. <i>Victoria</i> neared New York, Richard
prepared a letter to John Galloway. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Pal Jawn</span>—August will be your vacation month,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
I am a prophet and foresee much. Besides, you
admitted when I left that you would be free in August.
You are to go to Penn Yan (not China), New York,
and thence to ‘Red Jacket’—which is a house—and
inquire for your hostess, Mrs. Emma Wells. Some
time to-day I shall let her invite you.</p>

<p>“The daughter, Geraldine, will interest your Irish
heart. She sheds flattery as if she were used to it, as I
suspect she is; but she has never met your subtle
blarney. I’m on tiptoe to see the effect on her.</p>

<p>“But that isn’t the point. It may turn out to be.
We’ll leave it to the gods, who manage beautifully if
we are not too presumptuous. The point is a boy,
neurotic, just your kind; idiot with gleams of sense;
drinks, perfect guzzler, but not primary, you know.
<i>And I’ve got hold of the primary interest!!</i> It’s climbing trees
and furling spinnakers. Aren’t you itching to
get at it?</p>

<p>“I bet I’ve spoiled your vacation, O.K.! I hope so.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours,</span></p>

<p>—“Wait. I’m travelling incognito. It’s a glorious
experience. Wonder why I never thought of it before.
Accident—I mean the gods did it. Of course, we know
there ain’t no accidents, just incidents! My first name
is Richard and my last name is Richard—Richard
Richard. Can you beat it? Monotonous? Not at
all. There’s Dick Richard and Richard Dick and Dick
Dick. I wanted to have a middle name, Richard, too,
but got scared off.</p>

<p>“You don’t know the joy of incognito. To be free
from the everlasting questions. I’m beginning to see—data
for you—that the name hampered me, drew me
into myself, made me shy and backward except with
good old pals like you, Jawn, who know what’s what.
If I ever have a boy I’ll not junior him. Fancy a
George Washington, Jr. Think of the life of that kid!
And it sounds like George Cohan, too!</p>

<p>“Practise my new name. There must be no slips.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
More data—the boy (name, Walter Wells; age,
twenty-two; specialities, tree climbing, spinnaker furling
and wood alcohol) knows about the name, my name.
He’s holding it over me! I let him and we thrive
together. Also (more data) I give him two drinks a
day. Bring (more data) some superfine cognac.</p>

<p>“Lots more, but it’ll keep.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Richard Richard</span>.</p>

<p>“On second thoughts you’d better stand by in N. Y.
until I ’phone you, which means that you’re to pay the
train fare to Penn Yan. But amn’t I after getting you
free wittles for a month? And you know, Jawn, there
has been days when free wittles was not to be sneezed
at!”</p>
</div>

<p>With the characteristic directness of an egoist who
knows what he wants, Richard lost no time in searching
for Mrs. Wells. He found her in her accustomed place
in the lee of the bridge. She was propped up with
more than the usual number of cushions, and the pallor
of her face struck him instantly.</p>

<p>“My dear lady!” He sat beside her, his voice
genuinely sympathetic. “Don’t tell me you are succumbing
now, after going through the main part of the
voyage.”</p>

<p>“I am never seasick,” she said, with an imitation
of her old firmness; “just a little weariness, that’s
all.... That’s a good boy——” He was tucking her
in dexterously. “You are making me very fond of
you.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” he cheered her; “it’s a plot.”</p>

<p>“You remind me of what I’ve missed by being so
independent all my life. Sit down. You’re not going
to run away just because I look a little seedy, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>He sat down on the foot-rest of her chair.</p>

<p>“Here I sit, your squire to command,” he joked.</p>

<p>A little colour came into her face. She reached a
thin hand and patted him on the arm. There was not
a particle of doubt as to his interest in her. She was
twice his age, but their minds were contemporaries.
They had met in tournament mentally and jousted for
the sport of the thing; they had lent their minds out
to each other and had made broad paths towards
intimacy. And at the same time it was sweet flattery
for her to know that this strong youth—his thirty-three
years sat lightly upon him—was paying a kind of
court to her intelligence. As a rule the young men
had hovered about out of politeness, but were off at a
nod from the daughter.</p>

<p>“You’re a good boy,” she said. “I shall miss you;
unless——”</p>

<p>“I accept in advance!” he cried gaily. “You know
I’m a professional guest!”</p>

<p>“And also some sort of a widow,” she smiled.</p>

<p>“Assistant widow,” he corrected; “but please don’t
remind me of that. I won’t have to think of that until
the November exams. begin. Let’s talk of ‘Red
Jacket.’ You’re too tired to talk, so let me talk for
you, tell you what you were going to say. Gracious!
You don’t know what a silent crab I am usually. You
have brought me out, introduced me to speech, you and
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“What was I going to say?” she helped him, amusement
in her quiet tones.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he remembered. “You were about to
invite me to ‘Red Jacket’—Jerry let the cat out of
the bag—and I’m coming. We’ll have great old
pow-wows, won’t we?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>She closed her eyes wearily, but the contented smile
remained.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what a flutter you’re putting me
in.” She looked at him tenderly. “Women of my
age don’t often get such genuine attention from young
men. It’s so rare that—well, you’ll have to be careful.
Don’t give me too much of it. I’ll be getting
jealous of Geraldine next; begin to fool myself into
thinking I’m young again.”</p>

<p>“Young? Pooh!” He tossed his head. “Why
all this silly eagerness to be young? Age is the thing,
the goal. ‘Grow old along with me, The best is yet
to be, The last of life for which the first was made.’
You remember your Ben Ezra, don’t you? Well, that’s
the best of sense. Youth? It’s a time of folly and
bad thinking. You don’t catch a successful business
man sighing for the days when he had a tuppenny
shop with more debts than customers. We don’t pine
for green blueberries, do we? What’s all this march
forward of growth if it doesn’t mean something mighty
fine? Why, lady mine, I’m just eager to push on to
forty and to fifty and to sixty—to a hundred if I
could. Life’s a climax—always a climax; don’t bow
for a minute to the world’s sentimental nonsense over
youth.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she said thoughtfully, “you are right, of
course. I wouldn’t go back even five years.”</p>

<p>“Who would?” he questioned triumphantly; “which
proves my point perfectly. The world doesn’t believe
its own nonsense; and that’s a text for an enormous
arraignment of the world in all its beliefs. The credo
is the act, not the pious patter of the mouth. What a
man does, that is his belief, whether he knows it or
not.... Don’t you think you’d better close your eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and take a little nap? You look knocked out; has
anything happened?”</p>

<p>She opened her eyes resolutely. “Go on,” she said,
without answering his question. (“Ah!” he said to
himself, “something has happened,” but he gave no
sign.) “Go on. I’ve often thought that thought.
It’s not what you say about yourself; it’s what you do
that tells the story. That’s very true. Very true.”</p>

<p>What she was thinking—and some inkling of it was
in her voice—was that this young man was really
interested in chattering with her; that Geraldine often
protested interest, but her neglect was the truth; that
her boy Walter had never expressed either dislike or
affection for her, but his act in striking her in public
was eloquent. Richard sensed a specific application
but, naturally, he could not apply it exactly. So he
went on cheerfully:</p>

<p>“I’ve spent many delightful hours writing out the
creeds of various men. I’ve followed them to their
churches and into their businesses and, sometimes,
into their homes. This man who professes Christian
humility openly, who begs the world to turn the other
cheek, to forgive seventy times seven, who cries out
that the meek shall be blessed and shall inherit the earth—oh,
it is great fun to judge him by his deeds.
Arrogance and self-sufficiency rule him. He is merciless
to wife, child and employee. It takes a destructive and
criminal strike to squeeze decent wages from him. He
links himself with corrupt politicians for personal gain.
He connives at shady legislation. Oh, he is meek—in
after-dinner speeches and in addresses before the Sunday
school—and verily he well-nigh inherits the earth!...
And I have seen rough-spoken men whose acts are the
heart of humility.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Your arrogant man,” Mrs. Wells took up the
discussion, “I am interested in him. I am an arrogant
person myself, and I’m often sorry.... Within the
past hour I have been arrogant, and I am suffering
for it.”</p>

<p>Richard said nothing. Instinctively he knew she
would tell him, if it were proper for him to know.</p>

<p>She continued after a moment’s pause, “Could not
your arrogant man be sincere in all his professions; fool
himself, as it were?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. That is the interesting
thing to me. I’m an onlooker merely. I do not
condemn. I condemn nothing. Sincere? Undoubtedly.
But sincerity is no great virtue. Every persistent
burglar is sincere. He has no pricks of
conscience. Question him—as I have done—and he
justifies himself every time. Sincerity is the cheapest
possession, and the world values it too highly. The
Spanish inquisitors were sincere; so were the scalping
Indians; and Boss Tweed. And so were Lincoln and
John Wilkes Booth. So is the devil, for that matter.”</p>

<p>She laughed weakly. A little more colour came back
into her face.</p>

<p>“Your incongruous company is very amusing,” she
smiled, and began to sit up. He helped her with
pillows.</p>

<p>“The only point, isn’t it,” he said, “is not whether
a man is sincere, but whether he is wise or ignorant.
Now your boy, Walter——”</p>

<p>A flash of pain that came suddenly across her face
told him much.</p>

<p>“You have been talking to him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Was that wise?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“No.”</p>

<p>“Was he—violent?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have done it. I was—sincere, God
knows; but, as you say, I was ignorant——”</p>

<p>“Did he touch you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Let’s be frank. I’m trying to get him out of the
slough he’s in. I must know everything. Treat me as
if I were his physician, as I believe I am. He was nasty
to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he called me the vilest name.... We’ve
talked about that, I know; names should not affect us.
‘Sticks and stones,’ etc.—I know that is true; but,
man, you can’t know the surging, overwhelming emotion
that covers a mother when her boy calls her something
low, unmentionable—horrible.”</p>

<p>“Let’s forget that,” he said, “and get the gain out
of it. It means you must give up trying to control
him. Don’t care about that. It’s just like a doctor
when something that should stimulate depresses. He
changes the medicine as one would change a coat, and
with no more concern. You had to try this out, to see
if you couldn’t hold him. You could not give him up
without one more trial. That’s all right, and now you
must leave him to me. We’re getting along. He lets
me scold him. It’s my luck not to get on his bad side.
I may; nobody knows. But I’ve been able to suggest
lots of good habits. We walk miles together on the
deck, you notice. He’s getting some health back; and
I’m chucking him full of confidence. Cheer up. Don’t
let a name or two bother you. That’s just the devil in
him talking. Oh, he’s got a devil, all right, and I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the boy to exorcise it. You leave it to me. You will;
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I should.” She turned her face
away.</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s pride, I fear.”</p>

<p>“I am sure it is.” She turned her face to him with
a wan smile.</p>

<p>“Good!” he cried. “Honest confession is good for
the soul.”</p>

<p>“It is,” she admitted. “I don’t often practise it.
The puzzle to me is why I do it to you. Pray tell me,
O youth, what makes you so fascinating?”</p>

<p>“Am I?” He appeared hugely gratified. “How
jolly!”</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> who is proud?”</p>

<p>“Me! I own up. I’m bloated with pride. But I
always own up. It’s part of my creed.”</p>

<p>“Then, pray, own up something to me.”</p>

<p>“Name it.”</p>

<p>“Why—precisely why—are you willing to give up
your plans and your other friends and stay with us at
‘Red Jacket’? No fooling, young man; nothing but
the truth, the whole truth.”</p>

<p>He crossed his heart.</p>

<p>“Hope I die.” He imitated the children’s formula,
the charm to insure truth. “I want to come because I
like you—you and Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Me and Jerry. Not just me?”</p>

<p>“Nope—both of you; and the reason for that is that
I talk to you. I can always tell. I have only two joys
in life—curiosity about life itself, and talk. I’ve stayed
up all night for a good confab with the right person.
But only certain persons can I talk with. Don’t know
why; but I trust the instinct. With you and Jerry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
I am garrulous and contented. That’s enough for
me. There is another reason why I want to go—I’m
extremely interested in Walter. Curiosity about life, as
I told you, is one of my passions. I want to unravel his
mental puzzle if I can; and I think I can. I’m on a
most exciting clue——”</p>

<p>Should he tell her the whole truth; that she was
directly responsible for the boy’s downfall; that her
impatient arrogance, her stupidity in not realizing that
a sensitive man does not enjoy a public reprimand from
even his mother, was the beginning of all the evil that
followed? He looked at her aged face and decided to
say nothing.</p>

<p>“A most exciting clue,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Those reasons don’t seem adequate to me.” She
looked at him with smiling suspicion.</p>

<p>“Oh, there are other reasons, no doubt,” he agreed;
“only I don’t know them. They’ll come out later.
They always do. The subliminal—the self inside,
deeper than consciousness—it is at work, I suppose,
here as everywhere. I am expressing my predestined
self. But, of course, I don’t hold myself responsible
for that. That’s in the hands of the gods. My soul-mate
may be up on that lake of yours—dispensing soda
in one of Quackenbuster’s drug stores.”</p>

<p>“Quackenbush,” she corrected, amused at his air.</p>

<p>“Is it? All right. That’s one thing I don’t have
to remember. Quackenbush or Quackenbuster, it’s the
business of destiny, not mine. Although, I suppose,
when the time comes I’ll crow a lot about my good
judgment. Every blade of grass, no doubt, believes it
has chosen green for a colour.... But, why aren’t my
reasons adequate?”</p>

<p>“Well, they are not normal——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Ah!” he interrupted. “That’s exactly what I
claim to be, normal. It’s the rest of the conventional
world that’s abnormal.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember the Quaker,” she commented,
“who said to his wife, ‘Martha, all the world’s queer,
excepting me and thee—and thee’s a little queer’?”</p>

<p>“Honest Quaker!” he rejoined. “I’ve much admiration
for him. It’s the way we all feel. To me all
mankind is deliciously comic, all except me—and I’m a
<i>little</i> comic.”</p>

<p>Far off towards the stern of the boat someone uttered
a cry. It sounded at first like the gulls, which were
beginning now to follow the boat. But it was repeated
with a clear human suggestion. Mrs. Wells, with eyes
contentedly closed, heard nothing. Richard had performed
his office well; she was cheered and heartened.
So he deftly tucked in a stray corner of the rug and
slipped quietly away. Far off he had seen Geraldine,
her face in agony.</p>

<p>Fortunately the majority of the passengers had gone
down to early dinner. The deck was free as he sped
forward at full speed.</p>

<p>“Quick!” she called to him. “There! Walter!
Oh, quick! quick!”</p>

<p>The stern of the boat was narrow and almost cylindrical,
like the hull of a tank steamer. Only a hand-rail
and a life-saving raft or two gave any protection
against sliding off into the sea. Stumbling over the
odds and ends of ship machinery usually lashed down
here, Walter was making his way to the extreme end of
the boat. His unsteady gait and his occasional sprawl
at full length told the story.</p>

<p>“The rest of my cognac!” thought Richard, as he
leaped to the deck below, ran across a space full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
dismantled derricks and winches, and clambered up the
ladder which brought him back again to Walter’s level.</p>

<p>“Hi!” Richard called commandingly. “Come out
of that!”</p>

<p>He called to gain time. At the call, Walter steadied
himself on a life-raft and slowly turned himself about.</p>

<p>When he saw Richard climbing over a railing he
waved a hand and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Sta’ back!” he demanded thickly. “Going to stop
whole business. Sta’ back, I say. She wo’ let me ’lone.
Tol’ her I’d do it. ’N’ will do it. Sta’ back!” he
screamed. “Do y’ hear me! Damn y’ soul, I tell y’,
sta’ back!”</p>

<p>Just before Richard reached him his slow mind
realized that whatever he was to do must be done
quickly. On either side of him bulked the life-rafts, but
beyond, near the very end of the boat, was a cleared space
of several feet. Nothing but a low guard-rail of rope
protected one from the rounded hulk of the vessel.
Towards this open space Walter threw himself, clutched
the rail and flung his leg over.</p>

<p>At this end of the boat the ship motion was marked.
She would lower a dozen feet every few seconds and
fling herself up again rhythmically. It was the sudden
lunge up as Walter’s leg went over the rail that prevented
Richard from pouncing upon him in a single
leap. The two men were only a yard apart, but the
tilt of the vessel made Richard’s progress a climb uphill,
and when the ship started down again Walter’s
body had already begun to roll slowly over the rail
towards the deck. Once on that wet slant and he would
have shot bounding off into the churning sea.</p>

<p>With the tilt of the steamer downward, Richard
leaped forward, and seizing the hand-rope, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
gripped like iron, he catapulted completely over the
rail and on to the curved iron deck. The lunge carried
him against Walter’s slipping body, which his arm
encircled. As the steamer rose and fell Richard clung
to the guard-rope and hugged the boy to him in a terrific
grip.</p>

<p>“Le’ me go, damn you,” whimpered Walter, although
his head was nearly smothered against the deck. “Le’
me go, can’t yuh? Tol’ her I would; an’ I will. Le’
me go. Wo’ let her boss me. Le’ me go, I say! Aw!
Le’ me go!”</p>

<p>Richard tried to draw himself up, but stopped, fearing
that the boy might struggle; and besides, he did
not wish to risk losing his grip on the rail. Looking
off to the side he could see the curving edge, and
beyond was the white-capped sea.</p>

<p>Of course Geraldine had followed swiftly, and with
her she had brought a burly sailor. Someone had
cried, “Man overboard!” A small crowd began to
rush towards the stern. It was a simple matter to get
both men back on the platform.</p>

<p>“Come along, old fellow.” Richard lifted the boy
and encircled him with his arm. “You’re just feeling
a little blue; that’s all. Come along down with me
and we’ll talk it all out.”</p>

<p>The soothing voice, where he had expected reprimand,
had an amazing effect.</p>

<p>“Aw ri’,” he agreed cheerfully enough, as if risking
two lives was a matter of every-day happening. “Guess
y’r ri’; but she ought never come at me ’at way—spesh’ly
after I <i>tol’</i> her. You know, Rich’rd, I <i>tol’</i>
her. <i>Didn’t</i> I tell her?”</p>

<p>“Of course you did.” Richard drew him farther on.
“And what’s more, she won’t do it again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“Oh, yes, she will. You do’ know ’er.”</p>

<p>“She promised me she wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“She promis’, did she?”</p>

<p>“Gave her word she wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Gave ’er wor’, did she?”</p>

<p>He pondered over the fact.</p>

<p>“Tha’s fine!” he said. And after a few steps
further, he nodded his head vigorously and repeated,
“Tha’s fine! Good ol’ sport, mother; aw’ways keeps
’er word. Tha’s fine!”</p>

<p>In a few moments after, with the help of the ship’s
doctor, Walter was sleeping blissfully in Richard’s
room. Richard sat on a camp-stool and Geraldine sat
on Richard’s berth.</p>

<p>“Seems comfty, doesn’t he?” Richard gazed with
smiling interest at his charge and then looked into the
face of Geraldine.</p>

<p>“Has mother been after him again?” she asked.</p>

<p>Richard nodded good-naturedly, as if that did not
matter.</p>

<p>“He said he would jump over the side,” she shivered
at the thought, “if mother pestered him again. I told
her to look out. But she laughed at me. Does she
know about this?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to tell her?”</p>

<p>“I can’t make up my mind. Not just now, at any
rate. She’s pretty spent. Something has happened
lately to take the spark out of her.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve noticed that. She has aged frightfully.”</p>

<p>“That quarrel on the deck upset her. She’ll get
over it. We must wait. Meanwhile I shall not let
this determined youth get out of my sight.... I’m
sorry,” he added, as a thought occurred to him, “but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
you see now that I must go on with you to ‘Red
Jacket.’”</p>

<p>“Has mother asked you yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes; this afternoon—and I accepted.... Do
you mind?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She looked up at him frankly. “You like
the truth. Yes, I do mind; but this thing of Walter’s
has scared me.... I’m sick at the thought of it....
I see that you must come with us.... My only fear
now is—is that you won’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, my dear——” A faint smile
visited her whitened face at the remembrance of her
jesting on the top of the hill back of Naples.</p>

<p>Then tears came suddenly into her eyes, the after
effect of the scene she had just witnessed. She brushed
them away and smiled at the same time, a sunshine and
shower effect.</p>

<p>“Lord, how I have aged since Naples!” She spoke
with low emphasis.</p>

<p>“Of course you have,” said he. “You’ve grown up,
just as I predicted you would. And you’re much nicer
as a young woman than as a pert kid who knew
she was good-looking.... Now, don’t worry about
mother. She and I are irrevocable chums. I could
tell her the whole story—real name and all—to-morrow
and she would forgive me. But don’t fear her discovering
anything. I’m having the greatest joy out
of Richard Richard. I’m going to keep him alive as
long as I possibly can. It’s more to me than a new
name; it’s a new personality.... I’m just discovering
something.”</p>

<p>He stopped to think.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Names are important. Galloway told me once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
that the police changed the name of a street which for
years had been a veritable reproach and that instantly
the street took on a new tone and in the end cured
itself. He was indignant when I scoffed. But I see
he was right. This new name has transformed me. I
don’t know myself.”</p>

<p>“You, too, have grown up.”</p>

<p>“Really, I don’t seem to be the same person. I used
to be a recluse, a member of the Independent Order of
Glum.”</p>

<p>“You were.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, this was before you knew me.”</p>

<p>“Was it?” She looked across at him tantalizingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. The moment you came along I changed
my name and slipped out of my shell.... See here,
what are you grinning at?... Say, have I ever met
you before? I’m awfully forgetful.”</p>

<p>“I sat beside you for a full day on the way from
Genoa. First days out are never agreeable to me.”</p>

<p>“You did!” he ejaculated. “Why didn’t you
punch me?”</p>

<p>“I felt like it. A half-dozen passengers tried at one
time or another to talk to you, but you froze them off
with what seemed like malice.”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“I wanted to be alone. I’m in fine company when
alone.”</p>

<p>“So when I saw you on deck that morning in Naples,
I made a little bet with myself that you wouldn’t snub
me.”</p>

<p>“And, by Jove, I didn’t!” he cried. “Give me
credit for that!”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “you didn’t, but perhaps I deserve
a little credit for that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“You do,” said he speculatively, as if trying to get
the exact facts; “the evening before, I had seen you
counting a huge roll of bills. When you came towards
me that morning at Naples I decided to be friendly,
tell you my predicament and get funds for a visit to
the Museo Borbonico. It worked out splendidly.”</p>

<p>She smiled at what she believed was just playfulness,
and looked towards the sleeping brother.</p>

<p>“I’d forgive you anything now,” she replied quietly,
“but you fib too well.”</p>

<p>“A fib in time saves nine,” said he.</p>

<p>“Remember that, please, when mother gets too
inquisitive at ‘Red Jacket,’” said she.</p>

<p>The unusual ceremony of shaking him warmly by
the hand as she left the room was not misunderstood
by either. He returned the grip with equal fervour.
Both stood a moment and gazed at the boy. Then she
slipped quickly into the corridor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>“WE SHALL SEE”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Geraldine</span> went directly to her mother. She found
her in her usual place, forward under the bridge.
Evidently Mrs. Wells had had a little nap; she
looked refreshed and immeasurably better. An empty
tea-cup and a plate of toast was beside her, a sign
that she had had her dinner served on deck. It
occurred to Geraldine as she came forward that dinner
would be out of the question that evening. Indeed,
it took all her resolution not to go to bed from sheer
weakness. But the sight of her mother’s cheerfulness
and obvious return to health gave her will to go on.</p>

<p>“Hel-lo,” the mother sang softly, the two musical
notes that had been a family call for a generation. It
was the first chirp she had uttered since the scene
with Walter on deck. It encouraged Geraldine in her
determination to be frank.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Mrs. Wells, “where have you been?
Writing letters? I do hope you have jotted a
few postcards for me. I have been shamefully lazy.
Where is Richard? I owe him an apology. He was
talking away beautifully, giving me all sorts of little
thrills with his absurd poetical views, and I only closed
my eyes so that I could hear better—I did take a
teeny nap, but don’t ever tell the dear boy—when,
pop! he was off without my hearing a sound.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Geraldine stacked the remains of the dinner in a
pile near the rail, convenient for the approaching deck
steward.</p>

<p>“It was so comfortable up here this evening,” the
mother explained, for fear she might be accused of
weakness, “that I just had the steward bring me a
bite. The dining-room is abominably stuffy.”</p>

<p>“You are much better, mother, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Better?” She looked up sharply. “You talk as
if I had been ill. Nothing is the matter with me. I
get tired—the same as others, sitting around on this
boat with nothing to do but stumble over steamer-chairs.
What made you think anything was the
matter?”</p>

<p>Geraldine was expert enough in signs to know that
this topic had better be dropped, so she began on a new
line.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Walter this afternoon?” Geraldine
asked casually.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells knew she was under cross-examination.
Perhaps it was clairvoyance; undoubtedly she had a
kind of ability in reading the intentions of others that
amounted almost to mind-reading; but more likely it
was the consciousness of guilt that led her to avoid
this topic too. But she was unusually clumsy. She
fussed with her pillows, asked why the steward did
not remove the tea-cup and plate, and, finally, when
Geraldine, with calm persistence, came back to Walter,
Mrs. Wells pretended at first she had not heard, and
then asked petulantly, “Yes, I have talked with him.
Why shouldn’t his mother talk with him?”</p>

<p>“Do you think he is any better?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s coming along as well as I expected....
Aren’t those sunset clouds wonderful?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“Mother, aren’t you afraid of him?”</p>

<p>“Afraid of whom?”</p>

<p>“Walter.”</p>

<p>“Still on my Walter,” she parodied, and took great
amusement out of her deft sally.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of him, mother. I’m dreadfully afraid
he’ll go out of his mind and——”</p>

<p>“Tut! Tut!” Mrs. Wells interrupted. “Put that
out of your head, girl. I know Walter. And I know
how to bring him around. Afraid of him? Nonsense.
The fact is, I have been indisposed ever since we came
on board; therefore I have had to give way to Richard.
When we reach ‘Red Jacket’ I shall be myself again
and will take Walter in hand myself.”</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t, mother.”</p>

<p>A group of men came out of the companion-way
beside them. They were smoking their after-dinner
cigars and talking about the narrow escape of a
passenger from falling overboard.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Mrs. Wells asked the man nearest
her. “A man overboard?”</p>

<p>“They got him as he was falling,” the man replied.
He had a big voice and he seemed to relish the horror
of the incident. “They say a passenger was back at
the stern, a man it was, and he fell afoul of a coil of
rope or something and pitched over the railing.”</p>

<p>“I heard something,” Mrs. Wells remembered. “It
sounded like someone screaming for help, but I was
taking a little nap at the time and thought I had
dreamt it. Dear me! Isn’t it dreadful?”</p>

<p>Geraldine watched the mother, whose placid face
showed no hint of her intimate and personal connection
with the recital now going on about her in several keys.</p>

<p>A shrill-voiced man scoffed at the theory of a “man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
overboard.” It was the usual false alarm on board a
ship. Passengers have nothing to do, and therefore
they’re always glad to get themselves all fussed up;
they’d scream “Man overboard” if they saw a flying
fish.</p>

<p>Another person felt differently about the matter.
And he knew what he was talking about. He had his
information on the best authority. There was a man
really overboard—the second-officer was the authority—a
man overboard while the steamer was stoking ahead
at twenty knots an hour. And did they stop to hunt
for him? No. What would be the use? He’d be a
mile astern before we could turn about.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Wells from her throne among the pillows
cross-examined the men—a favourite rôle of hers and a
sign that she was coming back to her control of things—Geraldine
had dropped back into her chair, seized
by a horrid suggestion of nausea. Every vivid detail
of the struggle was made more vivid by the heartless
narrators. There had been much interruption as the
men rehearsed various versions and, worse, a lot of the
senseless witticisms that men employ to show that they
are a devil-may-care lot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells scoffed at the notion that a man, a
passenger possibly, had really fallen overboard and that
the vessel had gone on its way without any concern in
the matter. Had the second-officer himself told the
gentleman? Well, no; not the second-officer himself;
but he had told the thing in confidence to the quartermaster,
who had passed it along to the crew. It was
the bathroom steward, in fact, who had given out the
details.</p>

<p>“Ah!” Mrs. Wells was highly pleased with her
quiz. “On the authority of the bathroom steward!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
she chuckled. “You men know what the day’s run is
going to be, on the authority of the bathroom steward;
you tell us exactly when we shall dock, on the authority
of the bathroom steward. The male bathroom steward,
my dear sir, is the exact equivalent of the female
hairdresser.”</p>

<p>A quiet Englishman came into the group while Mrs.
Wells was expressing her suspicion of the theory of
“man overboard.” As others emerged from the companion-way,
which led up directly from the dining-room,
they stopped to listen. About six or eight passengers
lounged in chairs or stood about. From her enthroned
position under the bridge Mrs. Wells was naturally the
centre of the group.</p>

<p>“But, really, there was no man overboard, you
know,” the Englishman told Mrs. Wells. “I saw the
whole thing and helped to get the poor chap on his feet.
He wasn’t overboard, but he was jolly well close to it.”</p>

<p>Questions overflowed on the reticent Englishman.</p>

<p>Oh, no; he had done nothing—merely helped one
of the crew pull the two men up over the rail and upon
the deck. It was a tall, blue-eyed chap, the big fellow
with the hearty laugh, you know, the one who is everlastingly
tramping the deck—he’s the boy who gets the
medal. Why, he sprang right over the rail, depended
solely on the grip of his hand to hold himself from
sliding overboard!</p>

<p>“Back aft, you know,” he explained, “the vessel
bulges out like a flattened cylinder. There’s a little
foot-walk on the top of the cylinder with a bit of rope
on each side. The foot-walk’s quite safe, you know;
but one step over and you’re on a smooth, round slide.
A man might hold on if he’d lie flat and if the boat
didn’t jolly well wobble. But it does wobble, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
know; up and down with the rollers and then a side
shake or two; and, besides, it’s wet back there from
the spray and all that. Not much of a lark to try
to hold your own on that bit of tin.</p>

<p>“I was standing against the rail,” he went on, “just
off there, where our deck stops. A man and a woman
were quarrelling around the corner of the house. I
couldn’t see them, of course, and I couldn’t hear all
they said, but they were having high words, the man
was, rather, I should say. Well, the man’s voice
stopped. I heard the woman call after him. She
seemed to be begging him not to do something or other.
I couldn’t get it. Then she screamed. She screamed
twice. Quite startling, you know. Not loud, but—penetrating.
Went quite through one. Of course
I——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells interrupted. The man’s leisurely style
irritated her. She suggested, good-humouredly, of
course, that he might shorten the melodrama and get
to the tragedy.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” he agreed; “but this is the first act, you
know. Quite necessary, I assure you. For if the lady
hadn’t screamed I—well, I might have seen the chap
drive out aft and topple half over. Of course, I did
see him, you know. What I mean to say——”</p>

<p>“Prompter badly needed,” remarked Mrs. Wells
grimly. She had not relished the Englishman’s quiet
turn of her theatric figure of speech.</p>

<p>“Prompter?” he inquired blandly. “The lady
called and, being a gentleman, I ran to her assistance.
Nothing could have been prompter.” The Americans,
who love a pun, applauded, but the Englishman went
on as if he had not scored. “She was calling to someone
and pointing aft. Then I saw the man. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
got down among the life-rafts and had stumbled over
something or other. He lay sprawled out on the deck.
I started after, of course, although I saw no reason to
hasten. Between the life-rafts it is perfectly safe.
It’s just beyond where the trouble begins. Then I saw
the big chap. He was lugging it up the ladder and
calling, ‘Hi! Come back!’ The first chap, the chap
who had stumbled, he got himself up and ran farther
aft, and for a second it seemed like a race. But the
vessel lurched badly, or something, and the first chap—I
hope I am clear—the first chap smashed up against
the ropes. The impact carried his leg over. You
could count five while he slowly turned up and on top
and then began to fall over that rope rail to the deck,
you know.</p>

<p>“Of course all this happened while one might say
Jack Robinson; but it seemed to me he was devilish
leisurely—the first chap, I mean—in getting over
that hand-rail. Good thing, too. The second chap,
the big chap, was coming full steam ahead, charging
like mad. He needed every second and he knew it, so
he put one hand on the rail, gripped it, swung over,
came smash against the sliding body of the first chap,
and pinned him against the deck. And there he swung,
with an arm and a leg around the other chap, hanging
by one hand to that blooming, sagging rope. He’s the
medaller. I? Like a silly ass, I stood there watching
it all and let the woman pass me. She was on them
like a shot. Strong ’un she is; she had them both
fairly well up before the sailor chap and I could lend
her a lift. I hope I’ve made it all clear, but I fear I
have mussed it up. Rather beastly thing, you know,
two men dangling over the side and the old ship tossing
like a mad bull!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>The Englishman was an effective narrator after all.
His quietness; his hesitations—he puffed on a pipe
during the recital—and his child-like candour gave a
horrid suggestion of reality to his picture.</p>

<p>By this time Geraldine had recovered sufficiently to
watch her mother. Mrs. Wells’ swift mind had visualized
the scene; she saw the deck rise and fall and the two
men hanging over the depths. The horror of the thing
was on her face, Geraldine noted, but there was no
suspicion of Walter.</p>

<p>“I saw the two of them coming back,” a lady
announced. “They passed right by my chair. The
smaller man was fearfully wobbly at the knees and he
seemed dazed. He talked thick, like a drunken man,
and he smelled horridly of whisky. Of course that’s
what the doctor had given him to revive him. He
mumbled and talked foolishly. If I hadn’t been told
I’d have taken him for an intoxicated person.”</p>

<p>This clear description of Walter came to Mrs. Wells
with the cruelty of a shock; but she did not utter a
sound, or move a muscle. Rigidly she watched the
speaker, but Geraldine saw the colour fade from her
face, and her heart beat in pity.</p>

<p>Summoning her energies, Mrs. Wells rose slowly and
moved towards the companion-way. At the top of the
swaying stairs she pulled herself together, and went
straight to Richard’s room and knocked.</p>

<p>Richard opened the door softly, peered out and let
his face lighten up at the sight of Mrs. Wells.</p>

<p>“Come in!” he whispered, but in the tone of gay
mystery. “Walter’s taking a nap. Come in!”</p>

<p>She looked into the room. Walter was sleeping
soundly, thanks to the doctor’s morphine.</p>

<p>“No,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Can I do anything?” he inquired; “pull out
steamer-trunks, open a port-hole or—mix you a glass
of orange juice?”</p>

<p>His cheerfulness assured her. It was not Walter,
after all.</p>

<p>“Nothing, thank you,” she said. “Just passing by
and thought I’d tap and see if you were at home. I’ve
missed you. Why did you run away from me this
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“My speech put you to sleep,” he laughed; “so I
just tucked you in and slipped off.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t asleep at all,” she said. “Just dozing.”</p>

<p>“And I didn’t run away at all,” he mimicked; “I
just slipped off. But, isn’t there something you want?”</p>

<p>“No.” She moved on. “Good-night. I’m off to
bed. It’ll be a hard day to-morrow with customs and
trunks. Good-night.”</p>

<p>She was assured, but she would have given much to
have been able to ask him questions. She could not;
her pride forbade, that pride which Richard had accused
her of more than once and which she had confessed to
no one but herself and Richard. Obstinacy was a good
name for it; so was independence and strong will and
masterfulness. It was the quality that made her
dominant wherever she moved and, at the same time,
often mastered her and kept her from what she desired
most. Having gone so far as the man’s room in her
fear, and having found, as she thought, that fear to
have been groundless, she was too proud to admit her
praiseworthy weakness.</p>

<p>Richard followed her down the corridor to a door
that opened on the lower deck. “Good-night,” he
called after her softly. “Call again!”</p>

<p>She waved a hand lightly in recognition of his playfulness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
But she did not go to her room. With confident
step she ascended the tipping stairs and took her
accustomed seat among the pillows.</p>

<p>The group had dispersed. Only Geraldine remained,
crouched in her chair in the same position.</p>

<p>The mother hummed an air as she adjusted the
pillows and rugs. Everything was all right. The unfortunate
stoker or passenger, or whoever it was, was
not Walter. So spoke the external Mrs. Wells, backed
by a pride that never admits defeat. After all her
interest in the two selves, the self of consciousness and
the subliminal self of our deepest instincts and beliefs,
Mrs. Wells did not know that all her assumption of
serenity was a bit of acting. She really did not know.
When the cry from within told her that no one but
Richard could be the “big chap,” the “blue-eyed
chap,” the “chap with the hearty laugh, who is always
tramping the deck”; and that no one but Walter could
correspond to that thick-voiced small man with the
suggestion of an inebriate—when her strong instinct
for the truth cried out to her she shut the door, would
not listen, summoned her wishes and willed them to be
the truth.</p>

<p>So she hummed, and appeared serene. Evidently,
thought Geraldine, Richard has fibbed to her. Richard
meant well, but it was man’s mistaken chivalry to woman
and to age. He did not know her mother. He did
not know that her life had been a series of notable
successes against hard conditions and that every success
won by her will had made her invincible against opposition.
And he did not know that with the successes had
gone unspeakable blunders. After the event Mrs. Wells
had often admitted frankly that she had been wrong,
but always after the event. It took one year’s failure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of the grape crop to convince her, against every authority,
that her spray mixture was faulty. It took the
breaking of old Israel’s leg to convince her that a
certain nervous mare was dangerous. And so on and
so on. Her answer always was, “We shall see”; and
if anyone had had the courage to flaunt her with a list
of the failures of judgment, she might have invited such
a one to strike a balance of her successes. Six hundred
acres of land, mostly under cultivation, besides interests
in mortgages and shares in local wine companies—these
had engaged her judgment also, and to show for
it was what seemed on the surface to be a sound financial
success.</p>

<p>“We shall see,” the mother would say. Well, she
must be shown. The only question was how to go
about it.</p>

<p>“Mother,” Geraldine began resolutely, “what are
you going to do about Walter?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you well, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p>“You really look quite knocked out, Geraldine.
Why don’t you go to bed early to-night? You know
we’ll have a bad day to-morrow landing. You know
what the New York customs is. I’ve had such a good
nap this afternoon that I think I’ll just sit here and
moon. You go down, that’s a good girl. I’ll be
dropping along soon.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t answered my question, mother.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What question? I beg your pardon, dear.”</p>

<p>“I asked you what you were going to do about
Walter.”</p>

<p>“My dear, you are obsessed about Walter. He’s a
care, I’ll admit; and it’s bad enough that I have to
have him on my soul, but I do wish you would be happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
and not concern yourself about him. Even I don’t
wish to have him in my mind all the time. When we
get back to ‘Red Jacket’ I shall bring all the force
of my will to bear upon him. I shall force him into
good habits as I’ve done many a-time with a hunting
dog. He’ll ‘charge’ or ‘heel’ at my command.”</p>

<p>“But he hates it, and he has threatened to do away
with himself,” the girl implored.</p>

<p>“Naturally he hates it. So does the dog; but he
gets the right habits eventually and doesn’t spoil the
shooting by a lot of barking and prancing around.
There’s not a flaw in my theory, my dear. Of course,
I am sorry we must do this. I don’t like to treat my
boy like a dog. But we must face the fact. He is a
dog. He has got himself into the ditch; and we mustn’t
mind the mire—we must get him out. You wait in
patience, my dear; we shall see.”</p>

<p>That “we shall see” made Geraldine determined.
To the great relief of the mother she seemed to drop
the subject altogether.</p>

<p>“That man overboard,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes; horrible, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“They say he deliberately threw himself over the
side and struggled and fought against a rescue.”</p>

<p>“Why should he do that?”</p>

<p>“He was trying to kill himself.”</p>

<p>“Who says so!”</p>

<p>“Richard.”</p>

<p>“What does Richard know about it?”</p>

<p>“Richard was the man who leaped over the side and
held him until help came.”</p>

<p>“Richard!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And the man who——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“That was Walter.”</p>

<p>It was cruel, but was there any other way? Cruel
and pitiful. In the July twilight Geraldine could see
her mother age perceptibly. In a moment she seemed
to shrink and fade and grow a shade greyer. The firm
lines about her mouth loosened, giving her the look of
genial senility. It happens often to those who have led
rigid, muscle-tense lives; when they finally go, the result
is not a gradual growth but a horrid transformation.
Geraldine was frightened. She summoned help from
the passengers about her and sent someone off for the
doctor.</p>

<p>There was enough fighting spirit left in the aged
mother to object to all this attempt to help her, but
weakness finally conquered determination; she was
forced to give in and let herself be put to bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE FAITH OF A TREE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> the next morning Mrs. Wells appeared as
usual on deck and, with apparently the same imposing
mien as of old, watched the docking of the S.S. <i>Victoria</i>.
Externally she had altered little, but in a moment of
conversation with her it was clear both to Geraldine
and to Richard that she had “suffered a sea-change
into something rich and strange.” Had she packed
her bags? Had she locked up the steamer-trunks,
paid off the various stewards, arranged for the porterage
of trunks in the hold? Not at all. Why should she
bother about all that? What were husky young folks
for? And what was age for if not to levy tribute upon
youth?</p>

<p>Never before had she permitted anyone to do for her.
Now she shifted to the other extreme. She would do
nothing. And it was not at all unreasonable, she
assured Geraldine. Nor was it weakness, but rather
the result of strong decision. She willed now to have
others take charge of things, she said.</p>

<p>And so she fooled herself into a pleasant attitude of
mind. Indeed she joked about it. Sitting snugly in a
deck-chair she watched Geraldine and Richard as they
superintended the bringing of luggage to the surface
and having it stacked properly, labelled and lettered.</p>

<p>“Now I shall begin to be appreciated,” she announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
cheerfully. Geraldine had dropped beside her, spent
from the exertion. “When I did everything, nobody
knew what it cost me. I could worry over every hair-pin,
but nobody cared. That’s because nobody knew
the price I paid for their comfort. That was a
mistake, I see. I did too much. Now I’m going to
take a rest for awhile and collect. What a fool I was
to slave the way I did! And the blessed relief, now
that I’ve passed it over to you, Geraldine! I never
remember feeling so lazy and comfortable and—beatific!”</p>

<p>No doubt it really was a blessed relief to give up the
fight. Many dominant persons are like that; they
spend three-quarters of their lives bullying their families
into nervous servility, and suddenly plop down on the
said families for the remaining one-quarter and invite
themselves to be taken care of.</p>

<p>About Walter she said nothing. One never would
think that only the evening before she had been literally
struck down by the news of the horrible method Walter
had taken to rid himself of her constant espionage.
The shock had been terrific, for her confidence in the
eternal rightness of her judgments had given her no
preparation for the revelation when it came; but the
very severity of the shock served a good purpose: it
drove the whole incident into the depths of her mind.
It was now something far away, a grief that distance
and time had assuaged; something to be aware of,
of course, to ponder over sadly, but whose sting was
gone.</p>

<p>When Geraldine had told Richard of the graphic
description of the struggle as related by the quiet
Englishman, and then made clear the surprising manner
in which Mrs. Wells had abdicated, he said it was quite
normal so to act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Of course the shock did its work,” he said. “It
knocked her out completely. She may recover, but I
doubt it. She has held a mild despotism for the strong
years of her life. This is like a successful revolution
breaking out against her. Otherwise she acts in quite
a natural human way. In his lectures, James used to
enjoy telling about these freak shifts of character.
When we give up an ideal or an ambition it is really
a great relief. Instead of disappointment we actually
have happiness. James used to be fond of describing
the lady of thirty-five who at nine-fifteen of a certain
evening decides that she no longer cares to be thin.
That will be her first night’s perfect sleep. The
struggle is over. She tosses the dietary to the winds,
lets out her waistband, and takes to a rocking chair
and sets loose the springs of laughter. Your mother,
it seems to me, has been living on a strain; she really
carried herself a notch or two above her strength. It
will be a great joy to her to let down and be natural.
I predict you will find her a much more agreeable
companion after this.”</p>

<p>For the present at least Richard’s prediction was
verified every hour. Instead of the semi-querulous
person who checked off every article of personal belonging
and bossed stewards, porters, and even customs
officials, she walked down the gang-plank with only a
slender handbag and cheerfully sat on a trunk and
permitted Richard to superintend the irritating job of
going through the customs. She offered no advice, but
she was not slow to see the humour of the situation and
to proffer broadly satiric suggestions to the workers.</p>

<p>Walter, too, was in splendid spirits, splendid for
Walter. He tagged along with Richard and showed a
sort of weak interest in the formalities of customs inspection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
The fact that the mother had given her word
that she would let him alone made the day seem to him
like the first day of vacation. He was almost cheerful.</p>

<p>He followed Richard willingly enough because, he
assured himself, he had that man in his power. An assumed
name is not taken up without a lot back of it.
And Richard permitted him to think so, even going so
far as to take him aside more than once and have him
pledge all over again his vow of secrecy. Walter, too,
was fooling himself, pretending to himself that he was a
clever man, but all the while he was mortally afraid of
jail, and the unexpressed thought of it was the controlling
power in his attachment to Richard. No one had
ever suggested jail before. Like an irresponsible child
he had always been allowed to work his little game for
money. Of course they had scolded, but always they
had let him off.</p>

<p>When Freneau had come along to help he discovered
Richard in full charge of the Wells’ affairs.</p>

<p>“You run along, Professor,” Richard laughed him
aside. “You’ve done your job, but I’m looking out for
the two ladies and the boy now. No! I won’t have
you even find a customs man for me. I’m enjoying
this. It’s the first time I’ve ever really handled a
family. I’m feeling delightfully domestic—a brand-new
experience—and I want to get the last morsel of
enjoyment out of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” Freneau had agreed with his adversary
quickly; “that will be a great help, and I will
toddle off and see to the other members of the party.
Thank you so much.”</p>

<p>When all had been done that could be done the group
sat about on trunks and bundles of rugs to await the
heavier baggage, which was now being derricked out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the hold. Mrs. Wells on a pile of rugs spent the time
chattering her farewells with the two other ladies who
had made up the Freneau “party.” Walter sprawled
beside Richard on a trunk, and watched the derrick pull
up trunk after trunk. Geraldine had found a more or
less comfortable suitcase. They could see the heavy
baggage as it was being lifted out of the hold. Richard
had managed his trip on a commodious handbag, which
he had not permitted to go below in the hold. It was
Walter’s job to watch for Wells’ trunks, black with an
enormous white “W.”</p>

<p>A noisy insincere set of farewells were going off
directly beside them. Richard and Geraldine exchanged
glances which showed that they appreciated the banality
of every effusive phrase.</p>

<p>“It’s might cosy,” she said, “to have you going
right along with us to ‘Red Jacket.’”</p>

<p>The quietness of her tone and the sincerity of her
straightforward gaze was in contrast to the noisy group
breaking up beside them. And she not only meant it to
convey a contrast but a sign also that she had given up
her disapproval of his coming along.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to say that,” he said; “I know it.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I sense it; you know I have cultivated all the senses
in order to extract the last drop of elixir of life. I
sensed you from the very beginning—not very well, I
admit. I made some blunders there, but I got you
essentially, nevertheless.”</p>

<p>“Got me? Sensed me?” she smiled up at him.
“Excuse me for being amused. You talk as if you
were a hound and I—a pheasant!”</p>

<p>“I am a hound—I cavort around with my nose in
the air, eager to search out things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“But how did you sense me from the beginning?”
she came back.</p>

<p>“I knew you were the kind of woman you have turned
out to be. I did not judge you to be simply an astonishingly
healthy animal—your health is uproarious;
it shouts at one!—vivacious, gabbly, frothy——”</p>

<p>“Thank you; oh, thank you!”</p>

<p>“I thought you had a mind,” he went on. “I sensed
it. Your broad forehead showed it; the eyes wide apart
and large; the way you held your head on your neck;
the judgment and taste in your clothes; the inflection
of your voice; your choice even of slang; your laugh;
your frown; the care you spent on your body (no
woman is better than her hair!); your forced volubility;
your woman’s smile which belied the girlish
chatter—and so on and so on. That’s what I call
sensing you. Most persons go on words, but speech
is of very little use in judging persons. That’s why
the legal witness-box is so absurd.”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to think of that quotation—‘Twelfth
Night,’ isn’t it?—where Olivia gives an inventory of
herself; item, one nose; item, two eyes; item, one
mouth.... You gave me no impression you were
taking an inventory of my charms. But you are right
about words. I often mean the opposite of what I
say.”</p>

<p>“Yes! Speech is not natural. It’s an acquired
skill and a poor exponent of the self within. We are
always being fooled by it; and yet words are causing all
the trouble and misunderstanding in the world. We
should be able to look beyond words. That’s how I
came to give up being insulted.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage? I’m very sensitive to a
snub.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“I got to looking beyond the words to the real
person speaking. Do you remember Tittbottom’s
spectacles?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It’s in <i>Prue and I</i>.”</p>

<p>“Never read it; thought it was sentimental.”</p>

<p>“It is, but in a good sense. Tittbottom’s spectacles
are the best thing in it. He had only to put them on
and he saw the inner-self of anyone on whom he looked.
Well, I have cultivated the Tittbottom habit. I see the
impatience, the illness, the ignorance, the misunderstanding,
back of the words, and then I can’t be hurt.
Might as well be insulted because a leaf turns brown.”</p>

<p>“I believe you would forgive a criminal for being
bad!”</p>

<p>“Quite so. I would even forgive a good man for
being good!”</p>

<p>The racket about them was most persistent: the
rattling of hand-trucks, the bumping of trunks, the
roaring conversation of hundreds of embarking passengers—more
than one steamer had arrived that
morning—and the shouts and whistles that gave
direction to machinery. But the noise instead of
interfering with the dialogue cut the two off from
the rest of the world, isolated them, as it were, in
their own private room with invisible walls.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “whatever you are, I’m glad now
that you are coming with us.”</p>

<p>“I knew you wanted me to come with you to ‘Red
Jacket’ even when you said you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You ‘sensed’ right then. I did. But I was fearfully
afraid of exposure. I am yet. That’s why I’m
going to ask you to be very nice to mother on the train,
and then when you ‘sense’ the proper moment tell her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the whole story of our trip to the top of the hill in
Naples, your real name and everything.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must. I can’t stand the deception. You
can do it beautifully. Make her laugh: I can’t do
that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well. All right. If you wish it, but—Jove!
I was enjoying my incognito! I’ve taken on a
sort of new soul. All my instincts say to keep it.”</p>

<p>He looked at her for permission to go on keeping it.</p>

<p>“No,” she shook her head. “My instinct says, no.”</p>

<p>At that moment Walter slid off the trunk and stared
hard at a black trunk marked with a prodigious white
letter, swirling around in mid-air. The letter turned
out to be “M,” but it took him a moment or two to
decide.</p>

<p>“Jove!” Richard exclaimed again; “I must! It’s
part of the cure.” He nodded towards Walter. “The
only reason he listens to me is because he thinks I’m a
bad man like himself. I’m travelling about under an
<i>alias</i>,” he lowered his voice; “he thinks he has me in
his power. We talked it all over and swore each other
to secrecy. He’ll be talking about a percentage of the
swag soon! Oh, it wouldn’t do! We must leave things
as they are. Don’t you see my point?”</p>

<p>She did, but reluctantly. Walter came back to his
perch before she could reply; and a banging trunk,
turned end over end by the American system of
porterage, stopped all conversation temporarily.</p>

<p>The incident at Naples was a trivial thing, now that
she could look back upon it. Why had she not told
the mother the whole episode, omitting nothing, on the
very evening of the happening? Why had she feared
to own up? Here was another of those “mental facts”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
which Richard was so curious about. Mother would
have looked at her with mild disapproval and then,
probably, would have laughed at the whole affair. But
instead of being frank, Geraldine had been secretive;
she had literally created a situation that had had no
real existence. She had made a mountain out of a
little Neapolitan mole-hill. The evil lay not in tripping
off with an unintroduced male but in the careful and
prolonged system of concealment. It is easy to see life
in review; why cannot we be equally wise in the midst
of events?</p>

<p>When she propounded this mental obtuseness to
Richard he was full of illustrations to show how common
is that human experience. But he was glad it had
happened. It gave him a medley of new sensations;
and here he was, finding his greatest adventure at the
end of his adventure-seeking journey! Of that she was
glad too, she said. And he was glad she was glad;
for he admitted that he had become attached to the
Wells family like a mongrel dog.</p>

<p>“First you are a hound and now you are a mongrel
dog!”</p>

<p>“We’re very much alike, dogs and us. The skeletons
are strikingly similar—don’t you think—especially
when you set them up on end. Oh, we’re near cousins!
But I’m really mongrel. I go here and there. I have
no fixed home. I attach myself to all sorts of persons,
and—alas!—leave them for other persons. Like the
mongrel, I go where my spirit moves me.”</p>

<p>“You really are a sort of Quaker.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am very sensitive to the call of the Spirit—I
spell it with a capital because I believe we’re all part
of the same mysterious Impulse—I spell that with a
capital, too. We’re like good microbes in the blood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
working out our selfish ends, but all for the unknown
glory of something greater of which we are the unconscious
molecules.”</p>

<p>She accused him of being a pantheist. He admitted
it. Then she labelled him an old-school Presbyterian,
but he admitted that.</p>

<p>“The main point in the old Bluestocking,” he explained,
“is that as God had arranged it all, why worry?
They didn’t always stick to the main point, because
they were artistic creatures and loved the sensation of
startling pictures—infants broiling for ever in hell,
and the elect, who had done their darndest on earth,
safe in heaven be-harped and be-winged with the fright
of the pit still in their faces. But their main point is
unassailable. You can’t argue it away. Predestination?
Why not? We are observers, merely: it is
only an allusion that we act. I have no more choice
in going along with you to ‘Red Jacket’ than I have
in liking you immensely or being a biped or sitting on
this trunk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can do some things of our own free
will.”</p>

<p>“Name one.”</p>

<p>“We can do what we want to do, certainly.”</p>

<p>“That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever do something you don’t want to
do?”</p>

<p>“Never; although I fool myself into thinking that I
am making a decision. Do you think, for instance,
that you could stand on that trunk and sing ‘The
Star-Spangled Banner’ at the top of your lungs?”</p>

<p>She shuddered at the thought.</p>

<p>“I could if I wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Ah! But you can’t want to! I won’t ask you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
sing; but I defy you to <i>want</i> to.... There! You
can’t want to. It is predestined that you couldn’t
want to.... Now, what next am I?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” Geraldine was intent on this
old problem of free-will versus determinism; “do you
mean to tell me that I cannot choose between, say, simpering
at a man—like that fool of a girl over there—oh,
she knows what she is doing, all right, and why she
is doing it!—or being just myself?”</p>

<p>“I tell you simply that you cannot choose but be
just yourself. Vain persons choose vanity; greedy persons
choose to be greedy; simpering female adolescents”—he
turned to look at the young girl who was
flashing herself at the young man—“do their best to
choose a healthy male. And Easter lilies choose to
grow tall and slender and water chooses to run downhill.
Oh, Presbyterianism is a great faith for an indolent
chap like me—you cease to worry about the whirligig
of time; you didn’t make it nor set it agoing; and
you can’t direct it nor stop it. You leave it to the
Maker and go about your blessed selfish business free
of all responsibility.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you half believe all your beliefs.”</p>

<p>At some hour in the day or week, he assured her, he
believed many of them. He wobbled about a lot and
had a good time wobbling. The only fixed belief he
had was the belief that he should always be open to a
new belief.</p>

<p>Walter leaped to his feet; he had discovered a Wells
trunk, and was as delighted as a child.</p>

<p>“’At’s one!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“One what?” Mrs. Wells was startled.</p>

<p>“Trunks!” cried Walter.</p>

<p>“Goodness! I thought it was a fire!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“’Ere’s ’nother!” cried Walter again. “’Ere they
come. All of ’em!”</p>

<p>“Good work!” Richard slapped him on the back.
“You’re the boy! Now let’s rustle up a stevedore and
a customs gentleman and put them through.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells had given Geraldine the family purse,
and she in turn had passed it over to Richard. Like a
veteran tourist-guide, he paid small duties, fee’d the
draymen, arranged for expressage, called taxis, bought
train tickets and established his party in the rear seats
of an observation car. Not until they were speeding
out of the Lackawanna Station did he realize that he
had not telephoned Galloway. “Well,” he thought,
“he has my letter mailed on shipboard. He’ll find us,
all right.”</p>

<p>Then a ridiculous thought seized him. He took a
seat beside Geraldine and pulled from his pocket a thin
wallet, the one he had shown her on that first day
at Naples; from it he produced a solitary five-dollar
bill.</p>

<p>“Look!” he waved it.</p>

<p>She did not comprehend until he had brought the
family purse from another pocket and dangled the two
before her.</p>

<p>“I’ve bought my ticket out of your money!” he
cried. “Now wasn’t that clever of me! I still have
my five dollars to windward and good free meals ahead!
Oh, it’s a wonderful thing to have faith. The Lord
will provide.”</p>

<p>“Did you say ‘faith’ or ‘nerve’?” Geraldine
knew her man thoroughly now.</p>

<p>He looked at her with mock incredulity. “Woman,”
he said, “don’t you know that to have faith requires
the greatest nerve on earth? Nerve! Phew! Just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
you try to live in this world on faith alone. Then’s
when miracles begin to happen—they just have to!”</p>

<p>“I believe our part of the country will just suit you—the
country you are now being predestined to on our
predestined money.”</p>

<p>“‘Your reason, most excellent wench! Your exquisite
reason!’ That’s almost Shakespeare; so it’s
all right.”</p>

<p>“Penn Yan was first settled by a Quakeress, Jemimah
Wilkinson, who called herself the Universal Friend.
She believed in faith, just as you do——”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll be a Universal Friend, too.”</p>

<p>“But she put her faith to a severe test,” Geraldine
continued; “she announced a day when she would walk
on the waters of Lake Keuka as an exhibition to her
many disciples. And when they had crowded the
shores of the Lake and she had offered a silent prayer
and walked to the water’s edge, she turned to her
followers and asked them to renew publicly their confession
of faith in faith. As a test she asked them to
assure her before she should step out on the surface of
the water, that they had faith that she could do all she
professed in the name of the Lord. They all had absolute
faith, they cried. ‘Then,’ said Jemimah, ‘I need
not prove aught to ye who believe.’ Having said, she
turned from the Lake and went home.”</p>

<p>“Good for Jemimah!” said Richard. “I wager she
was a keen one. That was a bully rebuke to all that
side-show crowd. But my faith is different. I don’t ask
for miracles, since every breath I draw is a miracle. I
don’t think about it at all. I have the faith of a dog——”</p>

<p>“What sort of a dog this time?”</p>

<p>The train spun suddenly around a curve, throwing
him quite over against the lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Almost a lap-dog,” he laughed. “But I’ve been
working that dog too much lately. So we’ll change
the figure. My faith is the faith of a tree.”</p>

<p>“That’s a very beautiful picture,” she contemplated
the thought, “the faith of a tree—I wish I had it.
That’s what gives you your serenity—just like a great,
strong, shady tree.”</p>

<p>He was pleased and told her he was pleased; and then
defended himself from the charge of vanity by admitting
it and proving from his favourite Whitman, not only the
joy of vanity but the universal practice of it.</p>

<p>And so they “pow-wowed,” as he called it, for many
a mile. On shipboard it was Mrs. Wells and he who
had displayed to each other the eloquent wares of their
minds. Only once or twice had he and Geraldine talked
together, and then but for short intervals. The strong-minded
mother had seized on this man like a mental
vampire. But after Walter’s crazy adventure, the
spring had gone out of her mind; it no longer snapped
at ideas. On this journey she was content to doze in
the chair car, or drowsily read.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells had claimed the attention of Richard after
the change of cars at Elmira which had broken into one
bit of conversation begun on the observation-platform.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have good times together at Keuka,”
Geraldine had said; “better times than you dream of.
We have a big roomy place at ‘Red Jacket,’ with horses
and good riding roads; we swim, canoe, tennis, and
sail; there’s fair trout fishing and a bully good summer
climate. Later there is good pheasant shooting and
fine skating. And we’re absolutely secluded among the
hills. I live in a bathing suit until October. You’ll
enjoy tramping over the hills; and you can be alone to
your heart’s desire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“Oh, I’m going to like it! I sense it all.” He
pretended to sniff the joy in advance.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I like about you most of all?”
she suddenly confessed.</p>

<p>“No! Tell me. My egotism needs feeding.”</p>

<p>“You treat me like a human being.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he looked her over with great care, “aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“You treat me like a human being, not like a woman.”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“I’m grateful because you don’t seem to make any
difference. I like to talk to men—some of them; they
do so many interesting things. But all that I ever get
is a lot of—fluttering. They won’t talk to me as you
do. They twitter and fly away.”</p>

<p>“Birds of passage, eh?”</p>

<p>“Worse,” she pondered, as if out of deep experience;
“vultures.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” he dropped the bantering tone; “I
understand precisely what you mean. You’re right;
I’m not that sort. Do you know, I have a suspicion
that I am sexless. I always treat women as if they were
men.... But they won’t have it that way,” he shook
his head ruefully, “even the old ones. I’m tremendously
interested in many women, but sooner or later
they misunderstand my interest. Sooner or later they
shame me to the core. Are my ears burning?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. The very remembrance is awful.
Sooner or later they begin ... making eyes at me,
or they write me outrageous confessions and then—I
decamp! Of course I understand the law of the thing,
and if I could reciprocate I suppose it would be all
right and natural. Lord! I am interested only in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
their minds! You know Shakespeare advocated the
‘marriage of true minds’; but I haven’t found a
woman yet who took to it for long.... I can’t afford
to marry.... I won’t let the thought get in my mind.
I have closed my life to the things that tie me. ‘I
celebrate myself’ with good old Walt and decline to
attach myself to anything. Detachment—that’s the
only means of happiness. One must be an observer,
never a participant. That’s the artist’s point of view.
With wife and children would come a sort of pleasant,
altruistic slavery. Thank the Lord ‘Jawn’ Galloway
is a gentleman—I never need fear that some day he will
fall in love with me.”</p>

<p>At this point the break in the journey had begun.
For some unaccountable reason this speech had inflamed
Geraldine with anger. It was seemingly so pointed, so
carefully aimed at her. It was, as she took it, a notice
in advance not to trespass; indeed a hint that inevitably
she would trespass. Make eyes at him? Write him
confessions? Egoist? Egotist, rather! The colossal
vanity of the man! Well, she would show him. She
would prove an exception to his experience. And so
she fumed, but kept her outward calm.</p>

<p>As they stepped out of the train at Penn Yan and
moved towards black George Alexander, who stood
grinning and bowing before the door of the Wells’
family carriage, she managed to draw Richard aside for
a moment to say:</p>

<p>“You need have no fear, my dear charmer, about this
woman. She has no intention of falling in love with
you, exquisite sir.”</p>

<p>The smile that came to his face puzzled her. His mild
eyes seemed to be looking into her very “subliminal.”</p>

<p>“How can you be sure?” he asked searchingly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>TSHOTI-NON-DA-WAGA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Instantly</span> Geraldine knew that she had blundered.
The lesson of the value of silence she had not quite
learned, although she was making strides. After two
weeks of “non-committalishness,” as Mrs. Wells had
styled it, she had committed herself thoroughly. It
was now the turn of her own ears to burn. During the
late dinner and after she went to her room she flamed
at the thought of her silly speech. And it was not as
if the thing had come from her impromptu; she had
thought it all out carefully; planned even the order of
the words! With a phrase she would squelch this
exquisite self-centred gentleman. In the silent rehearsal
on the train the words appeared to have a
smashing, annihilating power. It seemed almost too
cruel to use them.... And their effect had been a
comic confession of girlish inability to take a general
discussion impersonally! In a smile and a look the
man had accused her of laying her mind bare, of giving
herself away by protesting too much.</p>

<p>In the morning the anger was gone, evaporated;
chagrin and mild humiliation took its place. In that
mood she met Richard at breakfast.</p>

<p>“I was outrageously angry with you last night,”
she confessed. They sat opposite. Mrs. Wells was too
busy getting into domestic harness again to have even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
a subliminal ear open; and Walter, as usual, remained
aloof.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he appeared to have forgotten the cause; “so
you were. Was it my fault?”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it was anyone’s fault,” she replied;
“that is, according to your view of things. It was
like a gust of wind. It swept over me. I present it
to your collection of interesting ‘mental facts.’ Your
suggestion that all women eventually make eyes at
you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, did I say that? Not all! It wouldn’t be true
to say all.”</p>

<p>“Well, the majority of them, even the old ones, you
said——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; not all,” he gazed out of the window towards
a rolling view of the Lake several hundred feet below
them, “for I distinctly remember a good old coloured
cook who didn’t.... But then I was only a child.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “Last night I couldn’t have seen the
humour of anything. Do you know, Sir Richard, I could
have struck you last night? If I had had my riding crop
in my hand I would have lashed you across the face.
Now, psychologist explain that brain storm, if you can.”</p>

<p>He did not turn his head from the window. The
scenery took all his eyes. In the darkness of the
previous night he was aware that the carriage had been
travelling up a considerable grade, but he was not prepared
for this elevation of about four hundred feet
above the level of the Lake. The house—the Southern
mansion type—turned its four enormous Ionic columns
half-way about so as to enjoy the vista down the blue
Keuka and the far ridges of high, misty hills.</p>

<p>“How can you keep your eyes away from that
wonderful view?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“It is wonderful, isn’t it?” She moved her chair.
“And don’t believe for a moment that I think lightly
of it. I was born in the room just above this—my
own room, now—and that view has coloured my whole
life. Nothing in Europe was half so good to me,
because <i>that</i>”—she threw a touch of a kiss to the
Lake—“that is home.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand you,” he spoke appreciatively,
“although I never had the sensation of home.... It
must be thrilling ... to be able to come—home.”</p>

<p>“You poor boy.”</p>

<p>Curiosity about his possible past came over her. It
was not the first time, but she withheld the question
that rose to her mind. Besides, the mother was hovering
near. And, besides again, he must not now be
asked to tell anything, not while he was a guest in this
house.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to exhibit ‘Red Jacket’ to you,”
she covered her exclamation quickly; “it must unfold
itself. There are dozens of views, but you must come
upon them unawares; and each has an inexhaustible
pack of scenes—I am always discovering new ones.
‘Red Jacket’ is a crafty old Indian; he’ll remain
stolid and silent as stone until you are ready to commune
with him. Those four great columns outside, for
instance; they are never the same. At first you will
glance at them and pass under, unless you wonder why
they put such huge columns on a dwelling-house.
Maybe you’ll make the usual joke and ask if this is the
post-office or the Carnegie library. You’ll be here a
long while before they grow big and you grow small;
and then you’ll pass them some moonlight night with a
little reverence; and on stormy nights you’ll be glad of
them and feel, oh, so protected when you are safe inside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>She talked with a smiling casualness—hesitating here
and there for a word—which took the eloquence out of the
speech, but left all of the affection and all of the poetry.</p>

<p>“You are very dangerous,” he spoke with decision
abruptly. “Your song of home is stirring primitive
instincts in me. Look out, or I may stick a bread knife
in my belt and stalk down that long hill to the cottage
I see at the edge of the Lake and run amuck among
some good man’s daughters. You are arousing my
domestic instincts. Please don’t force me to marry
somebody in self-defence.”</p>

<p>“What’s this?” Mrs. Wells caught a word.
“Marry in self-defence? What an ungracious remark,
Richard. I trust, if you do marry, you’ll marry for
the good of your immortal soul. You know it isn’t
good for a man to be alone; therefore it is bad; and
therefore, a lost soul.”</p>

<p>She was recovering some of her old spirit. “Red
Jacket” had done that. Since five o’clock she had been
wandering in and out among her hardy perennials, and
every blossom had given her courage. But the old vim
and assurance was gone; only the external imitation
remained. She looked almost as imposing and masterful
as of old; but the aggressive force was no longer
there. In its place had come a permanent yielding
sweetness, a charming thing; and, better still, a long-belated
sense of humour.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried Richard, “you are a theologian,
Mrs. Wells. Any seminary would pass you, except
possibly Union and Harvard Divinity; and they might,
because they believe in everything. Jerry has been
letting me into some of the secrets of ‘Red Jacket.’ It
begins already to domesticate me. But I see that ‘Red
Jacket’ has deep roots.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“You don’t ask questions and bring us out,” Mrs.
Wells beamed at him. “‘Red Jacket’ was built by my
grandfather. He came with his slaves from Virginia in
1818. George Alexander’s great-grandmother was my
grandfather’s ‘Mammy.’ You’ll find black folks all
over this country who are the result of that migration.
Grandfather Wells was a close friend of Red Jacket
the Seneca Chief. Red Jacket—the Indian, not the
house—was born just below us on the Lake; he was a
friend of the whites, you know, and was most helpful
in thwarting old Tecumseh. Grandfather was made a
member of the Seneca tribe. We have a heap of
mementoes of that in ‘Grandfather’s Room’ upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Really!” Richard’s eyes widened. “When may I
see them?”</p>

<p>“Wait, I’ll get you the key.” The mother was on
the way when Geraldine interrupted.</p>

<p>“Now, mother, you’re spoiling it. Don’t let’s get
the key. Let it wait. I don’t want to personally
conduct Richard about like a Freneau party. Let him
find out things for himself. If we tell him everything
it will spoil the surprise.”</p>

<p>The mother agreed reluctantly, and so did Richard.</p>

<p>“All right,” he settled back. “I’m game. I hate
to be told things. I do like to find them out for
myself. May I go anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Wells; “only be careful of the
under——”</p>

<p>“S-sh!” Jerry warned.</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!” Richard cried. “Mystery, plot and
underground passages! I am in luck. And I do hope
there’s heaps of danger.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure you’ve guessed,” laughed
Geraldine. “‘Red Jacket’ was one of the ‘stations’ of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
the Underground Railway which spirited negroes from
the South. This was one of the last ‘stations’ before
Canada. No! I won’t tell you any more. You are
free to go anywhere you please, but I wouldn’t try to
walk off Bluff Point after dark. It is only an eight-hundred
foot drop to the Lake.”</p>

<p>Richard elected to go first to the porch and sit in the
guardianship of the four Ionic columns. The Lake is
nearly a mile wide at this point and the view swept
southeast over a lengthened vista of water and rolling
vineyards.</p>

<p>“Would you like to be introduced?” Geraldine
nodded towards the great columns, which shot straight
up to the roof-trees. “The farthest one is ‘Tshoti,’
the second is ‘Non,’ the one to your left is ‘Da,’ and
the last one is ‘Waga.’ Put together they say Tshoti-non-da-waga,
‘People of the Mountains.’ That is
what the Seneca tribe call themselves, and here among
the mountains they lived and ruled.”</p>

<p>“My Indian history is rather shaky—but I’m eager
to brush up,” said Richard. “The Senecas were one
of the Six Nations, weren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they were the leaders of the Six Nations!”</p>

<p>She was standing as she spoke, gazing off far across
the Lake. She was brown and broad-cheeked, as so
many Virginians are. In that setting she took character;
and her pride as she said, “They were the leaders
of the Six Nations!” caused Richard to wonder.
Great-grandfather Wells, friend of Chief Red Jacket,
had been received into the Seneca tribe. Could it be a
touch of Indian blood that gave the erect figure, the
dark skin and the swart hair?</p>

<p>“Are you a Seneca maiden, I wonder?” he asked.</p>

<p>She turned swiftly and posed like a statue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“You should see me in my birch canoe,” she spoke
after a second or two. “For your private joy I’ll
braid my hair in two thick plaits and put on a genuine
Tshoti-non-da-waga costume out of ‘Grandfather’s
Room.’ Then you <i>will</i> wonder. Oh, my dear Sir
Richard, you are not the only one to have mysterious
pasts!”</p>

<p>Instantly he took up the jest—if it were a jest—and
parodied Longfellow at her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Tell me, tell me, lovely maiden</div>
<div class="verse">Of the Tshoti-non-da-waga,</div>
<div class="verse">Do you still sneak up behind one</div>
<div class="verse">With a scalping-knife extended</div>
<div class="verse">For to—uh—lift one’s curling ringlets?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>She was quick to answer in equally bad doggerel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“No! nor does the lovely maiden</div>
<div class="verse">Of the Tshoti-non-da-waga——”</div>
</div></div>

<p>She stopped for a moment to get the next lines
smooth, and then went on swiftly:</p>

<p>“Good shot!” he cried. “Hey, Walter!” Walter
had lunged along after Richard. He seemed to enjoy
being present, so long as he was not bothered. “Hey,
Walter, what do you think of that for poetry? It’s
enough to make old Ralph Waldo Longfellow turn over
with envy.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Walter sniffed in a very, very knowing way.
“You’re all right—you two!”</p>

<p>There was something almost sinister in his look. He
had sized them up, it said.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Geraldine began to flame
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Jerry!” Richard caught her arm and pressed it
significantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m on!” Walter snapped. “Go to it, you
two. It’s all right. It’s <i>all</i> right, I tell you. I don’t
care. I’m no squealer, I tell you. Go ahead; on’y no
use puttin’ up no bluff with me.”</p>

<p>In a moment Jerry was standing before him, her eyes
blazing. She was about to seize Walter and shake
him. But Richard followed quickly and put his arm
completely about her shoulders and held her to him.</p>

<p>“There now, Jerry,” he soothed. “Of <i>course</i>
Walter’s on. Why shouldn’t he be? He’s a good
sport, and he might as well be in this, too. I’ll have
no secrets from Walter. I tell him everything. It’s
the only way to treat pards——” Richard’s pressure
on her arm was telling her to join in the stratagem,
that it was the only thing to do; but it took her
several bewildering seconds before she comprehended.
Then she made amends; her dramatic instinct came to
the fore, and she laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Walter, you’re a keen one,” she nodded towards
him, and slowly disengaged herself from Richard’s grip.
“You’ve got the mind of a——”</p>

<p>“Tshoti-non-da-waga,” Richard put in quickly for
fear she would spoil all with a too ironic figure.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s not what I was going to say,” she
considered, “but it will do.”... She moved briskly to
re-enter the house. “Prowl around, Richard. I’ve a
duty or two in the house and then let’s all go down to
the Lake. I’m keen for a swim in real water.”</p>

<p>“But Walter doesn’t swim,” Richard objected. She
stopped at the doorway. Geraldine was not always
considerate of Walter, but Richard remembered that
the care of Walter was his chief claim to “Red Jacket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Never mind me,” Walter crouched in his chair
sullenly.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you a boat?” Richard turned to the boy.</p>

<p>“No!” he growled. “Can’t have nothin’ ’round
here.”</p>

<p>“Mother would not hear of owning a sail-boat,”
Geraldine explained; “we’ve always had to go passenger
on somebody else’s.”</p>

<p>“Who owns that sloop over there?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That’s George Alexander’s. And it isn’t a sloop,”
corrected Geraldine; “it’s a cat-boat.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s confiscate it for Walter.”</p>

<p>Walter looked up with interest. His “pard” had
the right spirit. Alone the boy would not have
had courage, but the big man’s blue eye spoke a
determination that was contagious.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Walter, and got on his feet.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it up with Mrs. Wells,” Richard
explained. “Walter’s got to have a boat, a real boat—what
do you call them—class something or other?”</p>

<p>“Class A scows.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. We are going to have one, Walt, if I
have to crib the money somewhere. But for the present
you fix up that ‘cat’ down there and let her go. If
you don’t come home alive, I’ll break the news to the
home folks. Go along, old boy.” Geraldine had gone
into the house. “And when you get back, feeling just
right for it, we’ll have a little nip, eh? Just a teeny
one—or maybe two teeny ones, eh? When we changed
cars at Elmira I blew myself—Jerry’s money; good
joke!—for a quart of something guaranteed all pure
food.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Walter, and added, “saw it in your
room this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Did you! Good! Well, go to it, old man; and
don’t forget to work up a proper thirst.”</p>

<p>Walter grinned and sauntered down the hill. He
understood. It was a bribe to keep him quiet. Oh,
that Richard Richard was a smart one, a good fellow
to keep next to! He wasn’t straight with others, but
what did Walter care? Something crooked about this
Richard Richard—too glib and good-looking to be
anything but crooked—but Walter was done with
good people. He was a bad man and Richard was his
sort. All right. He would not squeal, but he would
have to get his “divvy.” That’s all he cared about.
So long as they let him alone and gave him his share,
they could make off with the whole shooting match....
Nice little revenge on mother, too; she thought
herself so smart, and now she was being taken in all
right.... Go to jail, eh? He wondered if Richard
Richard was clever enough to keep out of jail. He
hoped so. He would never “squeal.” As far as Walter
was concerned there’d be no killing of golden-egg geese.</p>

<p>From the porch Richard could see the boy—in spite
of his twenty-two years one could think of him only as
a boy—as he stumbled slowly down the hill, disappeared
for a few minutes in a growth of striking Lombardy
poplar on the very water’s edge, and pushed out in a
tender to George Alexander’s cat-boat. He watched
the tender made fast to the floating buoy, saw the sail
go creaking up, fill and send the boat like a live thing
out towards Bluff Point and the main branch of the
Lake.</p>

<p>Lake Keuka—Keuka is Seneca for “crooked”—is
shaped like a bent-over “Y” with Penn Yan at the
right-hand upper tip, “Red Jacket” at the left and
Bluff Point protruding into the stem. From the porch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Richard could see the whole length of the left-hand
branch of the Y and a mile or so on to the farther shore
of the “stem.” It was a soul-filling sight; but he had
room enough left in his soul to consider Walter and to
begin the perfecting of a plan for getting him on his
feet, first physically and then mentally.</p>

<p>He was in the midst of what looked like splendid
strategy when Geraldine appeared dressed for a swim.
She wore an easy-fitting suit which stopped at the
knees, a brown stuff—like taffeta silk, guessed Richard,
it being the only silk he knew by name except <i>crêpe de
Chine</i>; and as it melted down into brown stockings and
brown moccasins and up into a brown band about the
hair, Jerry stood revealed an Indian princess. That is
what he told her—that and other things—after he
had recovered from the delight of looking at her. He
said all this in the presence of Mrs. Wells, who had
come out under the shelter of Tshoti and his three
sentinels to take an enforced rest in a “rocker.”</p>

<p>“Your bathing suit, Richard, is down at ‘Lombardy,’”
said Jerry, “just back of that row of Lombardy
poplars, Mrs. Norris’ cottage. She keeps extra
suits for us and lets us track our wet feet all over her
house. Mrs. Norris is a gem and a saint; if you don’t
worship her we’ll all hate you, won’t we, mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed,” mother rocked away. “Phœbe
Norris is a saint, if there ever was one on earth. She
lived ten years with a crazy husband, took care of him
and kept him easy in his mind until he fortunately died
for her. And now she lives for others. She rents her
vineyard out on half-shares, which gives her all she
wants in this world.”</p>

<p>“So she spends her time preparing for the next?”
Richard queried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Oh, she’s not that kind of saint!” Both women
laughed at the thought. “She’s——”</p>

<p>“Mother!” admonished Geraldine. “Please let
Richard discover us properly. You are for ever guide-booking
him. Phœbe Norris could never be explained
with words.”</p>

<p>“Quite true, my dear,” the mother smiled at the
thought, “quite true.... It does my soul good to get
into an American ‘rocker’ at last.” She shifted the
topic easily; and then shifted again at the vision of
Jerry before her, one of the many signs of the change
that had come over her. “Isn’t it strange, Richard,
that my girl should be the athlete and my boy should
not even be able to swim?”</p>

<p>“Why should he need to swim?” Richard had laid
his plan and went resolutely to put it into execution.
“Very few sailors can swim. Walter’s a born sailor.
Do you know that you are going to buy him a boat
and let him lift the Lake cup?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” she turned to this confident man with a
touch of her old resentment towards being managed.
“I said he should never own a boat or sail it alone
until——”</p>

<p>“Of course you did,” Richard interrupted, glancing
down upon the Lake where Walter was plainly coming
about on his second tack. “We all say a lot of foolish
things. And now you’re going to buy him one and let
him employ that mind of his. If you don’t,” he raised
his voice to drown the beginning of a protest, “you
will send him to the devil as certain as if you had signed
his commission. Weak as he is, he’s got your Virginia
determination; and when he goes to the devil it will be
on the gallop. I know; for I am a strong man, but he
almost succeeded in breaking down my grip on the rope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
rail on the <i>Victoria</i>—all by sheer will, too—and if
he had——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells ceased rocking. She looked helplessly at
Richard, mutely begging him not again to force that
picture into her mind.</p>

<p>“Well,” he spoke calmly, “you are going to give up,
aren’t you—for the sake of that boy?”</p>

<p>Walter had broken a tack suddenly in the middle of
the Lake, obviously to take quick advantage of a change
of wind.</p>

<p>“Yes—I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Good! Now let’s go the whole way forward. Not
only are you going to let him have the boat, but you are
going to tell him so—without a word about the past;
just as if the matter had never come up before—and
you are going to give him the money so that he may
buy it himself.”</p>

<p>She protested faintly that that would only be tempting
him.</p>

<p>“It’s a risk, I admit,” Richard agreed. “I’ll be
frank; we run a chance. But my conviction is that
what that boy needs first is our faith in him. I have
a bottle of whisky in my room, put there purposely to
see if he would keep his word with me. He told me he
wouldn’t touch it except when I—well, uh, he said he
wouldn’t touch it. I had faith and put the stuff right
out in the open; went off and left him alone with it.
Not a drop touched!... You will do this, won’t you?...
It’s part of my plan to put him on his feet.”</p>

<p>The splotch of white, Walter’s sail, was growing
increasingly smaller; evidently he was making for the
narrows which led into the main body of water.</p>

<p>Yes, she would do as he suggested, although it went
against the grain to give in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“Of course it does,” he cheered her; “we’re all built
that way, but, let me tell you, the joy you will experience
in giving up will compensate you for life.
Blessed are those who occasionally give in, for they
shall inherit the joy of living.”</p>

<p>They left Mrs. Wells silent and stationary on the
porch. Down the driveway and across the State Road
Jerry marched on silently. She was disturbed more
than she wished to express. So she kept slightly in
advance of the man and started ahead. He had
achieved his little victory so easily, but he had no
conception of what that surrender revealed to the
daughter. She had never before seen her mother so
weak, so mentally benumbed. Who in the past would
have dared accost her as this guest had jauntily done?
The sharp satiric tongue would have withered him;
he would have been struck in a dozen vital spots before
he had half been aware of any attack at all; and the
indescribable “manner”—poise, bearing, what you
will—would have quelled him.</p>

<p>But this worried woman on the porch had seemed
eager to give up and get rid of a vexing gentleman.
There was something very pitiful in the contrast and
it filled Jerry with foreboding. She stopped as she
crossed the State Road and looked back. Mrs. Wells
had begun slowly to rock; soon she was going her
regular pace, a sign, Richard hoped, that she had cast
upon him all her burdens. Farther down the hill they
could see her bobbing forward and back between the
massive stolidity of “Da” and “Waga.”</p>

<p>Concerning her mother Jerry could not bring herself
to speak aloud; nor would she disclose in
feature or tone any hint of her fear. There were
other things on her mind, however, which could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
properly be brought forth to the light of familiar
conversation.</p>

<p>“We’ve been interrupted horribly lately,” she began.
“If it keeps up I’ll be irritated and show my claws at
you again.”</p>

<p>“I see you have claws;” but his eyes were on the
steep road.</p>

<p>“I blow up,” she admitted.... “If I had struck
you last night it would have hurt, and I should have
meant it to hurt; but the moment after I should have
been terrifically sorry. Why should I have flared up
so, I wonder?”</p>

<p>It was the traditional female attitude, probably, he
suggested, carefully keeping from the suggestion made
to her at the time that her vehement protest of independence
was the sure sign of the beginning of dependence;
the female bristles most and kills less, because, he
supposed, they grow angry for protection and not as
hunters. Traditional female attitude and also the
common human sensitiveness to words. He need not tell
her what he thought of that. She was insulted again!
Always permitting herself to be insulted. Even the
gods should not be able to insult via words. But
humans like to be insulted. She protested. He insisted;
it feeds their pride, he said, and arouses their
combativeness, both great human delights. Every
human and every nation is eager to be insulted; it’s
the hard job in life not to insult them.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps. But he had been so irritatingly
calm; so serene; so confident of his ability to charm.</p>

<p>But why not be confident if one does charm?</p>

<p>Who is proud now?</p>

<p>Not he! No more proud of his ability to charm
than he is of his ability to eat an omelette. Why should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
one be proud of so universal a quality? Look about
you, he adjured her, at the successful matings—he did
not mean marriages. The dog’s-meat man is fondling
the hand of the cook with the scraggly hair! “Beefy
face and grubby hand!” Men kill one another for the
veriest drabs of women, and women grow desperate
with jealousy over the blankest of males. Everyone
has charm; the Lord knows why he distributed it so
generally.</p>

<p>“Mawnin’, M’s Geraldine!” a happy, shining darkey
plumped at them from among the grapes.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Bolivar,” she waved a hand.</p>

<p>“Mawnin’, M’s Geraldine!” called a voice a little
below on the other side of the road. Through the corn
another black head peeped out.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Saul.”</p>

<p>There were several other “Good-mawnin’s,” to each
of which Geraldine responded with the name of the
black salutatorian.</p>

<p>At table and near the house Richard had noted the
coming and going of many negroes. Mrs. Wells had
said that nearly one hundred years ago her grandfather
Wells had brought his slaves with him from Virginia.
In that time there must have been much marrying and
giving in marriage. Had the progeny of this prolific
race stayed on at “Red Jacket”? It seemed so. He
was about to ask her, but her mind was tenaciously on
her flare-up of the night before. With the greatest
attempt at tactfulness she was trying to show him how
lightly she had conceived the matter—she would cure
her blunder of speech by more speech!</p>

<p>“Well, you made me angry, and I showed my claws.
I’m glad I didn’t scratch, because it is all over now and
I am not in the least angry with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“You must be angry with me often,” he talked and
slid along the pebbly incline; “it’s a sign of affection.
I believe the Serbian word for darling is almost the same
as ‘I’ll strangle you.’ Loving and strangling are very
close together. I don’t know why. The two electric
currents are charged, I suppose, and the slightest
contact starts a flash and a shock.”</p>

<p>“But I was angry with Walter, too,” she said, “a
few moments ago, when he made that absurd suggestion
about us. And here we are combining for his good—not
our own.”</p>

<p>There were many things he might have said here.
He had his own opinion of the cause of her anger, but
he did not care to broach it. Was she going to make
eyes at him after all, and hardly before he had got
settled in this beautiful place? He did not care to
leave just yet.</p>

<p>He decided to avoid the dangerous topic, over which
she fluttered with such obvious interest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Phœbe Norris was not at home, but her house was
open to the four winds. In a neat little room Richard
found bathing suits of many sizes, and managed to discover
a fitting combination of upper and nether garments.</p>

<p>A whir and a splash told him that Geraldine had
taken her plunge and was throwing herself about in
joyous abandon. Out of his window he soon saw her,
going at a swift pace, hand over hand, a splendid
“crawl” stroke.</p>

<p>The sight gave him a quick thrill. Here, too, was a
swimmer, not a dabbler in pools, but possibly one who
could do a long journey with him. It was pleasant to
swim for miles alone; but it would be a new and
rare experience to troll along with a companion. He
hurried his preparation in anticipation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>She was swimming past the floating dock when he
prepared to dive.</p>

<p>“Come on!” she challenged, and struck out into the
Lake.</p>

<p>He dived and followed. Both were using the long
side-stroke, and after several minutes there seemed to
be no diminution of the space between them. As she
swung her head from side to side she would look back
occasionally and smile at him tantalizingly.</p>

<p>“Come on!” she seemed to say; “if you can.”</p>

<p>As they got out beyond the shore trees she noticed
about a mile away the white spot of Walter’s sail
coming down towards them before a light breeze, and
altered her direction and made towards it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>SAINT PHŒBE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun was shining pleasantly over Bluff Point,
and the temperature of the water was absolutely neutral
to the swimmers. It was glorious swimming, thought
Richard. He was enjoying it and he knew that Jerry
was equally happy. As they drew near the boat—Walter
had seen them and had trimmed his sail to
meet them—he lengthened his stroke. Instantly Jerry
lengthened hers. The space between them had not
changed a foot. He wondered if she could hold the
new stroke, a slow but powerful overhand; but his
wonder increased as she held it without effort. There
was not a splash or an ungainly movement in her swing.
When he slackened for fear of pushing her too hard,
she imitated instantly. It was as if she had determined
exactly how much distance should be between them.</p>

<p>Walter brought the little boat into the wind with
such expertness that Geraldine had but to reach out her
hand for the stern. There she waited triumphantly for
Richard. She counted with satisfaction the fifteen long
swings which represented the amount of her victory.</p>

<p>As he reached up beside her and caught the edge of
the boat she waited for him to congratulate her. She
was an exceptional swimmer, and he had just found it
out. This time she would not blunder by speech.</p>

<p>But his eye was upon Walter. “Good work, old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
man!” he exulted. “You turned that boat about with
the precision of a Dutch watchmaker. That’s what I
call skill!”</p>

<p>Walter laughed, the excited laugh of a boy pleased
with an earned compliment. It was his second laugh in
Richard’s remembrance, the first genuinely hearty one.</p>

<p>Jerry clambered into the boat. Richard followed.
Walter eased the mainsail and went on his course
towards the dock.</p>

<p>“Bully good work!” Richard went on. “You’ve
certainly got the number of this skiff, all right!”</p>

<p>The two swimmers had gone forward, where they
lounged and rested in the full warmth of the sun.
Walter sat by the tiller, one hand controlling the
mainsheet, ridiculously proud.</p>

<p>“Thirsty?” Richard called back.</p>

<p>“Sure. And hungry, too. Puts an edge on you,
this does!”</p>

<p>Hungry! That was a fine sign.</p>

<p>“Well,” Geraldine was forced to bring up the topic,
“I beat you.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he affected great surprise, “were you
racing?”</p>

<p>“Good sport, you are,” she smiled ironically. “Own
up; you tried to overtake me, and I wouldn’t let you.
I saw you lengthen out and then let up. I’ve been
waiting for this ever since you boasted that you could
swim. I had lots more left, and in a spurt I can
‘crawl’ like an express train.”</p>

<p>“Knew she’d win,” Walter nodded proudly. “She’s
beat all the men ’round here. That’s what scares ’em
off. She always asks ’em to go swimmin’, an’ ’en she
makes ’em look sick.... Can’t blame the fellows for
scarin’ off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>That was a long speech from Walter. Richard
rested and reflected on it. This boy was no hopeless
case. It was just a question of letting him lead a
natural healthy life, he thought. But Geraldine, full
of her victory, rejoiced that she had humbled the big
man into silence. Was he wrinkling his face on account
of the sun, or was it sullenness?</p>

<p>“You wanted to win,” he answered her thought
quietly.</p>

<p>“Naturally. A woman likes to beat a man,
occasionally. That’s the latest female sport.”</p>

<p>“Why should anyone want to win?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Pooh! Philosophy!” She would not let him take
her victory up into the empyrean where it would disappear
into insignificance. That was the way of these
clever argumentative chaps. After they slap you in
the face, they cry loftily, “Think of all the millions of
years that are gone and are to come, and what matters
a little slap!” The answer is to slap back, a little
harder—twice, if you can get it in—and echo, “Aye!
Mere dust on the wing of eternity!” He had tried to
overhaul her; she knew he had tried; he gave up because
she was the better swimmer. “Pooh! Philosophy!”
she ejaculated. “Let’s be practical for once.”</p>

<p>“Philosophy is always practical; philosophy is simply
trying to think straight, even against our best wishes.
It is disinterested and terribly curious. So when I
ask, ‘Why should anyone want to win?’ I am disinterested
and tremendously curious. Do you really
know?”</p>

<p>In her own case she knew exactly. The calmness of
this man had begun to irritate; he was so sure of himself;
he could not be disturbed. She wished to humble
him, to drag him out of his secure serenity. Few men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
can stand a beating from a woman. She hoped to
punish him a little by winning. All this she knew,
but she said:</p>

<p>“Instinct, I suppose. I never inquire about instinct.
Might as well ask why we eat; the answer is, because
we’re hungry. Why are we hungry? Because we need
food. Why do we need food? Instinct!”</p>

<p>“A philosopher come to judgment!” he laughed.
“You reason exactly like a philosopher. The average
man does not bring up at that answer; he says, ‘I am
hungry because I am a wonderful creature, the exceptional
thing in the universe—I have an appetite!’
Haven’t you noticed the pride people take in their
appetites? When philosophy tells you it is a common
instinct over which we have no control, it is very helpful
and very practical. It saves us from a deal of comic
pride.”</p>

<p>“You have no instinct to win, I suppose?” she
taunted him.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied thoughtfully; “that’s why I am a
failure.”</p>

<p>Some of her throbbing aggressiveness slipped away
from her at this speech. She remembered the deck
scene on the <i>Victoria</i> when she had listened to Richard’s
announcement of his occupation as “professional guest”
helped out by occasionally acting as “assistant widow.”</p>

<p>“It would be much better for me,” he went on, “as
the world judges values, at least—if I could want to
win. But I can’t want to. You see, I am an individualist—I
obey my own law. All the world is eager to
win; I find that I am not. Fortunately for me there is
plenty of chance for the fellow who doesn’t care about
getting ahead of some other fellow. There is practically
no competition. He has a kind of monopoly!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Everybody wants to win,” Walter contributed
determinedly. “Racing, now—what’s the good of
racing if nobody wanted to win?”</p>

<p>“One could enjoy the race, striving to the utmost,
without wanting either to win or lose.”</p>

<p>“Can’t see it,” said Walter.</p>

<p>“The struggle is the thing—not the result. The
result is with the gods, but no one can take from you
the delight of contesting all your powers. Then there
is a joy in giving up to others, an exquisite joy which
few people seem to practise.... Yet Christ taught
it.”</p>

<p>“Like Phœbe Norris,” suggested Walter.</p>

<p>“Ah, the saint!” Richard remembered.</p>

<p>“She’s a young woman,” Jerry explained, “only
twenty-eight, yet she gave the ten best years of her life
to an insane husband. He went out of his mind while
they were half-engaged to be married. Phœbe insisted
upon the ceremony. Talk about giving! Yet Phœbe
is the cheerfullest red-head in Jerusalem township.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so red,” Walter objected.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a torch!” Jerry laughed.</p>

<p>“Well! Well!” Richard showed interest. “Saint
Phœbe attracts me mightily.... I thought she was
an old woman.”</p>

<p>“She ought to be, considering the sacrifice she has
made of her life—but she isn’t; not by a jugful. Wait
till you see her!”</p>

<p>“I don’t need to see her,” Richard stretched himself
out more comfortably. “It is enough to know that you
who know her know nothing about her. Sacrifice?
Why, you talk of sacrifice like a Quaker paying a
bill.... I wager that Phœbe Norris is no saint at all.
She’s had the finest time of her young life, that’s all—doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the most selfish act in her character—giving up
to others.”</p>

<p>Objections came from both ends of the boat, Walter’s
suspiciously vehement.</p>

<p>“Listen, my children, and you shall hear true philosophy,”
Richard broke in. “For some persons the only
joy is having and holding; for a rare few the only joy
is giving. Find out what a man wants, the givers say,
and give it to him quickly. But first want nothing
yourself—or want everything equally. If he covets
your watch, give it to him; you can tell time by the
sun and by the stars; or better still, do without knowing
the time at all. ‘Give all thou hast to the poor,’
the poor devils who cry so loudly for the baubles and
gewgaws.”</p>

<p>Sailing before the wind is like not sailing at all.
Wind and ship are in perfect balance. Except for the
swish of water flowing by, the sensation is of standing
still. Suddenly the silence was broken by a rapid flapping
of the sheet. Walter swung the tiller over and
pushed the boom out with his foot and held it there
steadily.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” Richard inquired languidly. He was
enjoying the rest and the sun and openly drank in the
sensation of living.</p>

<p>“Dead,” explained Walter, referring to the abrupt
failure of the wind.</p>

<p>“Dead? Good!” murmured Richard, stretching
himself full length. “O Death, where is thy sting?”</p>

<p>The wind had not died out completely; there was just
enough breeze short of a complete calm to pilot the
boat by inches and enable Walter to tack squarely off
towards the farther shore.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better get in?” Jerry inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Sure!” grinned Walter; “wind over there.”</p>

<p>Richard shaded his eyes.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” he asked. The unrippled
water seemed everywhere.</p>

<p>“Always is, with clouds going that way,” he pointed
overhead.</p>

<p>“But there’s no sign on the surface. Seems just as
dead as here.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see.”</p>

<p>In a few moments wind struck the top of the sail.
A fair breeze seemed to be floating along four to five
feet above the water. Soon Walter came about and
tacked straight for the dock. A good sailful was his
all the way.</p>

<p>“Magic!” Richard cried as they sped along through
the glassy water.</p>

<p>“Wind-pocket,” grunted Walter. “Comes off the
hill, I guess. This Lake’s full of them. Got to know
’em if you want to do any racin’.”</p>

<p>Was this a good time to tell Walter about his mother’s
change of mind on the subject of the ownership of a
“Class A” boat? It seemed so. Richard was turning
over in his mind the proper phrase to use—one had to
be cautious, for the very mention of the word mother
might easily drive all that eagerness out of the boy’s
face—when Jerry harked back.</p>

<p>“We’re always having half-conversations,” she said.
“I like to finish things; get ’em over and off your mind.”</p>

<p>“Get it off, then.”</p>

<p>“You think you let me win?”</p>

<p>“Can’t tell,” he drawled lazily; “haven’t tried to
race you yet.”</p>

<p>“When will you? This afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Let’s wait.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“I like to get things done.”</p>

<p>“Better put it off,” he advised, “you’ve a better
chance if you get into trim. You can’t jump at these
long swims without tuning up for them. You’ve been
out of the water for several months——”</p>

<p>“I swam in the Seine three weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“You mean in the shore baths?”</p>

<p>“No; in the river.”</p>

<p>“In the July races?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Glory be to Peter! Did you win?”</p>

<p>“Fifth place—out of forty-two entrants.”</p>

<p>She exhibited the edge of her bathing suit, whereon
was sewn a tiny silk badge showing that Jerry had
entered as a member of the “Club du Siècle” and that
she had achieved fifth place.</p>

<p>“Did mother——” he began.</p>

<p>“Not till it was all over; I had hard enough trouble
bribing my way into that ‘Club du Siècle.’”</p>

<p>“Jove!” he exclaimed; “you unfold beautifully!
You don’t show yourself all at once. It’s just like a
magnificent strange flower coming out of the bud. I
must make a new set of judgments on you every little
while.”</p>

<p>He ignored Walter, although the little boat threw
them close together. Jerry gave a significant glance
towards the boy, but Richard would not have it.</p>

<p>“He’s all right” he laughed aloud. “Walter is on;
he might as well hear everything.”</p>

<p>Walter leered at them knowingly.</p>

<p>“It makes my flesh creep,” said Jerry. Walter’s
simple brain had no translation of that speech, but
Richard understood. Walter’s dark statement of the
morning that these two before him were merely clandestine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
philanderers had irritated the woman almost
into blows; and even yet, when she understood that this
mentally ill-balanced brother of hers had to be humoured,
the low interpretation put upon the very wholesome
and natural relationship between Jerry and Richard
was nauseating. It was the knowing leer that made her
flesh creep; and, of course, Richard understood.</p>

<p>“It is necessary, I fear,” said he appealingly.</p>

<p>“I understand. Go on; I’ll try to get used to
it.... You were saying something sweetly pretty
about me which I shouldn’t want to miss for anything.
You were comparing me to a budding sunflower, I
think.”</p>

<p>“A sunflower, yes; provided one had never seen a
sunflower,” he explained. “In a flash I understand
something about you which has puzzled me heretofore.
You know, I began by analyzing you—on the hill at
Naples.”</p>

<p>“Yes; you told me I had the deportment of an
octogenarian and the language of an infant.”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” he grinned; “since which time you have
improved wonderfully. But that’s not my point just
now. Now I understand why you flared up so when I
suggested that all women eventually made eyes at me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she affected boredom; “why are you
always bringing up that topic?”</p>

<p>It was the first time he had brought it up; in fact he
had been all morning diplomatically diverting the lady
from just that topic. But he made no remark about
this characteristic feminine disavowal of facts.</p>

<p>“Because I have just discovered why you were
angry——”</p>

<p>“I was angry, angry enough to strike you, because
without waiting to find out what sort of a woman I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
was you hinted that before long I’d be—— Well, sir”—a
little flash of her old anger came back—“I am not
the sort to make eyes at anyone or write anyone letters
of confession!”</p>

<p>“I believe you!” he agreed, so firmly that she knew
he was speaking from conviction. “And that’s why
you interest me.”</p>

<p>He didn’t know why at first, he said. Deep within
the “subliminal” the reason of his interest was hidden.
She had giggled and spluttered like an over-grown child,
he told her. (Thank you, she said.) Kid-women he
had never taken any stock in—those that gabbled
without thinking or whined like spoiled babies, or substituted
flippancy for conversation. Indeed, at the
very start on the starboard rail of the <i>Victoria</i> she had
exhibited all the female qualities that ordinarily sent
him flying; but he was interested from the beginning.
Always he trusts his interests, not his reason; reason is
only useful in analyzing what is already done; his
“interest” led him to ignore the personality number
one which she presented at the starboard rail. Result:
Keuka and personalities numbers two, three, four and five!</p>

<p>She listened contentedly. There is no glow warmer
than that which comes on being understood!</p>

<p>“Of <i>course</i> you wouldn’t go soft like all the others!”
he announced. “I treated you like a man, and you
responded like a man. You have the point of view of
a man and the physique of a man. The arms fool
one,” he looked critically at her rounded arms. “One
forgets that muscles don’t show on a woman. It’s the
feminine layer of fat that all the magazine doctors
have been talking about lately; but the muscles are
there. That silk medal tells me that, even if I didn’t
know,” he made a wry face, “from experience.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>By this time all her resentment had vanished, had
oozed beautifully away. She had lost even her desire
to beat him in a swimming match. While Walter was
making the dock, she confessed some of her athletic
abilities, one of which was long-distance walking. They
would swim across the Lake, take early morning canters.
He chimed in like an old comrade. They would do
stunts together! Meanwhile, he reminded her, they
had responsibilities with Walter.</p>

<p>That youth brought his little boat around, fished up
the mooring float and dropped his sail almost in the
same act. Then he clambered into the tender and got
ready to row ashore. A queer impish look was fluttering
over his face; his mind seemed on the point of
expressing something. Once or twice he opened his
mouth, but thought better of it and pulled a stroke or
two. Encouraged by the slight distance, he rested on
his oars.</p>

<p>“You two can swim in if you want to,” he announced;
“or you can go below!” When one considers that
George Alexander’s cat-boat had not so much as a cabin
on it, this was a stupendous jest from Walter. The
two swimmers were appalled at the unexpectedness of
the witticism, but they were bowled over by the remark
that followed. “Do what yuh please, you two. That
‘cat’ won’t squeal!”</p>

<p>Then he pulled sturdily away.</p>

<p>“It’s a joke!” cried Richard.</p>

<p>“I bet it is!” echoed Jerry.</p>

<p>“He’s alive! Any man who can make a jest is still
alive!” he exulted.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Jerry shook her head. “It sounded
uncanny to me. That’s the first sign of humour I’ve
seen from Walter for a ‘coon’s age.’ Even when he’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
drunk he’s surly. I’m afraid it means the breaking up
of what mind he has.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think he is improving?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Wonderfully. He talked two or three consecutive
sentences out there on the Lake. It gave me quite a
shock to see him so garrulous. And then, this joke——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think this would be a good time to tell
him about his boat?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem much interested.”</p>

<p>“I hate to discourage you,” she shook her head;
“but Walter is no good.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that.”</p>

<p>“He’s better now, I’ll admit. But you should have
seen him when he has been drinking for a week. Ugh!
The very smell of him is piggish and loathsome! He
is twenty-two years old, and he hasn’t done a stroke of
work all his life.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I, and I am older by a decade.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you always tell the truth about
yourself.” Her quiet tone searched him. She seemed
suddenly to peer into the privacy of his mind, and to
discount all his gay philosophy.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he answered soberly; “I don’t.”</p>

<p>This was Richard’s nearest approach to moodiness.
Troublous thoughts showed on his face.</p>

<p>“I try to be honest,” he turned to her.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” she replied sympathetically.</p>

<p>He thought for awhile. “I talk everything out,” he
explained. “It annoys folks, I see.”</p>

<p>“I like it.”</p>

<p>“I know you do.”</p>

<p>“Even when it is just silly.” She would not let him
feel too secure!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“That’s what I most fear, that all my honesty is
leading me to no honesty at all.” He was too absorbed
in himself to notice her gibe. “Sometimes I wish I
could foresee the future and gather what my life really
means after all. Deep within me I feel there is a tremendous
change coming. I feel almost like a caterpillar
grub just before he bursts into a butterfly. All my
philosophizing may be just caterpillar-views; I’ll laugh
at it all when I take my first winging flight across the
hills. Don’t take my sayings too seriously.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! When have I ever done that?”</p>

<p>“Good point!” He recognized the hit. “Let’s get
back to Walter. He’s not hopeless. Didn’t you see
the way he manœuvered that boat? Didn’t you notice
his eyes? The first signs of intelligence I have seen in
them. He was interested in that boat and vain as a
rooster when we flattered him. Given interest in something
decent, with a little vanity, and anybody can be
saved. Let’s swim in and break the news to him. I’m
awfully hopeful.”</p>

<p>“Walter’s lazy beyond belief,” she said as they
swam.</p>

<p>“So am I,” he admitted promptly, “and proud of
it! ‘Lazy’ is a much-abused word. In a world of
work it has got a bad name. But it is the ideal of all
workers, after all—the state they save and strive for.”</p>

<p>Walter was sitting on Phœbe Norris’ little porch,
which overlooked the water. Now that the trip was
finished he seemed to slump into despondency. His
jaw dropped and his eye took on the stare of an idiot.
Certainly he looked a hopeless case.</p>

<p>Richard took a rocker beside him. Jerry stood back
and watched.</p>

<p>“Can’t get over that wind-pocket,” Richard tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
to stir him into mental wakefulness. “Still looks like
magic to me.”</p>

<p>Walter’s face became animated. He had cat-boated
all over the upper part of the Lake, he told Richard,
ever since he was big enough to steal away from home.
He knew a lot about that Lake that the other fellows
did not know. Upon being pressed for further information,
he said that he had sailed with the two best skippers
on the Lake, Captain Fagner and Captain Tyler,
but he could tell them a thing or two. Tyler was a
careful man; he knew the Lake pretty well, but he took
few chances; sailed a steady race and often won through
sheer sticking to it. Fagner was more daring; he broke
all the rules—split tacks when there seemed to be no
good reason; dared shallow water when the sail was full;
declined to reef until the stick began to pull out the back
stays, and won often through sheer pluck. But there
were some things about the Lake that neither man
knew.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Richard; “when you get your own
boat, Captain Wells, we’ll make those fellows hump
themselves.”</p>

<p>At that the light gleamed a moment in Walter’s
eyes, and then went out.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to be your own skipper on a
regular Class A boat?” Richard asked.</p>

<p>“Sure,” Walter mumbled; “but,” he jerked his head
toward “Red Jacket,” “what’s the use of talkin’?”</p>

<p>“None whatever!” agreed Richard. “We’re beyond
the talking stage, old boy. Mrs. Wells is going to
stake you for a real boat.”</p>

<p>The idea did not get into the boy’s head. He rose unsteadily
and said, “When are yuh goin’ up?” meaning
“When am I going to get my promised drink?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“But you are really going to get a yacht, Walter,”
Jerry told him. “Mother said so, this morning.”</p>

<p>Jerry had been astonished at the intelligence Walter
had exhibited in his story of the two skippers. The
kind, somewhat grim Walter she used to know had
appeared fleetingly on his face. She began for the first
time to have hope that this disgrace upon the family
would disappear. She, too, had to change her opinion of
persons; the value of Richard’s plan for the regeneration
of this youngster began to appear.</p>

<p>Walter sat down, frankly disturbed.</p>

<p>“She s-said so, did she?” he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes!” Jerry cried enthusiastically. “Richard got
her to promise. How soon can we get one?”</p>

<p>Nervousness seized him. He turned to speak, but
stuttered and stopped.</p>

<p>“They’re made in Wisconsin, aren’t they?” she
asked.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“We’ll telegraph,” Richard suggested. “Perhaps
they have some already built.”</p>

<p>Walter shook his head. They waited for him to get
control of his voice.</p>

<p>“Fag—Fagner,” he managed, “has one, new one,
ordered. Said—said this spring he’d let me have
it.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Richard. “Where is it now?”</p>

<p>“On the w-way,” Walter stuttered. “Saw him last
night in Penn Yan. S-said it was on the w-way.” He
took a brace and went on more smoothly. “Said it
had won races out there. Said I could have the <i>Moodiks</i>
if I wanted it; could have my choice.”</p>

<p>Jerry explained, “The <i>Moodiks</i> is probably the
fastest boat on the Lake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Gave you your choice, did he? Well! He’s a
real sportsman, now, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He—he’s all right,” nodded Walter. “Ev—everybody’s
fair ’n’ square up here.”</p>

<p>There was a certain tilt to his head and an odd look
at Richard that both he and Jerry noticed.</p>

<p>“All right, Walt,” Richard spoke softly. “Got
you your boat, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” but he shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>With the steadiest gait Walter had shown in many a
day he trudged up the hill.</p>

<p>“He seems to suspect you of something,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Poor boy!” He watched the retreating figure.</p>

<p>“Why should Walter suspect you of anything?”
she asked.</p>

<p>He turned to her inquiringly.</p>

<p>“You don’t, do you?”</p>

<p>She hesitated; he laughed.</p>

<p>“No!” she spoke quickly. “You misinterpreted
me. Only—Walter’s tone seemed so—significant
of——”</p>

<p>“Has Walter’s tone always been significant of
anything?”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it,” she spoke hurriedly. “Go in and
get dressed. I’ll wait for you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>An unaccountable suspicion took possession of her—unaccountable
because Walter’s brain was not worth a
burnt sulphur match, and any thoughts he might have
should be laughed at. But for the moment he had
seemed so sane—just like his old self—steady and
dignified. He seemed to be warning Richard. And
Walter was her brother—pshaw! but an idiot of a
brother. Still.... After all, what did she know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
about this Richard Richard? Not even his name.
Clever? Undoubtedly, but the cleverness that has employed
itself often before and knows all the answers.
Might he not be a clever impostor trying to gull two
country women and a half-witted boy?</p>

<p>Appearances were all in his favour; but swindlers
were no longer the villainous-looking desperadoes of the
old melodrama. Certainly he was different from any
man she had ever known—but then she had known
only good men.</p>

<p>Then she thought—it came to her in a stunning
flash—of the scene on the stern of the <i>Victoria</i>, the
two men swaying up and down on that slanting iron
deck; and remorse seized her. When Richard came
out, she went swiftly towards him and held out her
hands. He took them inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, my dear,” she smiled up at him, sure
that the endearing term would recall their domestic
playette at the top of the hill back of Naples.</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“For suspecting you of being a villain,” she smiled.</p>

<p>“What made you suspect?”</p>

<p>“Walter must have got on my nerves,” she explained.
“You see, I really don’t know anything about you, and
you <i>are</i> peculiar, and I had no experience with villains;
and so putting nothing and nothing together I was
trying to make a total.... Well! What are you
puzzling over? We’re even, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“How, pray?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you suspect me of being a flirt?”</p>

<p>He disengaged her hands carefully.</p>

<p>“And still do,” he spoke gravely.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a villain.” She jokingly struck at him.</p>

<p>“I admit it.” He caught her hands and warded off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
the blow. “All good-looking women are unwitting
flirts, and all men are potential villains—the one
beckons and the other—doesn’t the classic song indicate
that it is the villain who ever pursues her?”</p>

<p>“Villain?” cried a hearty voice from within the
Norris cottage. “Who’s tryin’ to play villain on my
front lawn?” A magnificent head of red hair parted
the curtains that served for door and mosquito protectors.
“Jerry!” cried Phœbe, “you angel-child!
Come over here and hug me! Who’s your young man?”
she asked as the two young women rocked together.
“Do I—or do I not—hug him too?”</p>

<p>Richard opened his arms.</p>

<p>“Decide, O angel-child. Quick, decide!” he cried.</p>

<p>Jerry emerged laughing from Phœbe’s strenuous
embrace.</p>

<p>“No!” she decided.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” cried Richard.</p>

<p>“Don’t it beat all?” echoed Phœbe, with a fine
imitation of a disappointed damsel.</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, if I can’t hug him,” Phœbe resigned herself
briskly, “tell me his name and let me get acquainted
as quick as possible. Although I think you make a
mistake, Jerry darling, not to let me hug him and get
over with it. He’s the most willin’-lookin’ creature
I ever clapped eyes on, and I’m sure we’d be both
enjoyin’ an innocent bit of lovin’. And mebbe if we
had it out now right before your eyes we’d have done
with it and not go hankerin’ after it behind your back.”
Her rapid-fire tongue gave no one a chance. But,
meanwhile, as she talked she pushed chairs out and
arranged comfortable cushions. “There! Sit ye down
and tell me all about it. What’s his name and where
did you find him? Here! Sit here! I’ll half turn
my back on him, he’s that temptin’. Why don’t some of
you be talkin’ and not make me do all the entertainin’?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she a wonder?” cried Jerry to Richard.
“Look out! She’s always up to mischief when she
begins dropping her ‘g’s.’”</p>

<p>Red-head she was, and eyes of absolute blue; and her
lips curved in perpetual merriment.</p>

<p>“Saint Phœbe!” ejaculated Richard.</p>

<p>“The same,” she agreed. “Me halo’s in the wash.
But be quiet, young man, until you’re introduced. I’m
a respectable widow, and awful seductive—I mean,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
susceptible. Ach! Don’t look at me that way like a
Gibson pen-and-ink sketch! Do you want me to be
eatin’ out o’ your hand?”</p>

<p>She turned her chair and faced Jerry.</p>

<p>“Who is the handsome creature?” she asked pathetically;
“and how did he ever get out of his picture
frame?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Norris,” Jerry took up the spirit of the game,
“may I make known Mr. Richard, Mr. Richard
Richard?”</p>

<p>“Is that his name?” she asked without turning
around, “or are you stuttering from nervousness?”</p>

<p>“His name is Mr. Richard Richard.”</p>

<p>Phœbe looked over her shoulder at him incredulously.</p>

<p>“That’s not a name,” said she; “it’s the chorus of a
song. Do you mean to say your last name’s Richard?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“And you say your first name’s Richard, too?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a wedding.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Your middle name isn’t by chance Richard, is it?”</p>

<p>“I tried to have it that way,” he explained, “but——”</p>

<p>“The family voted you down, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. You see, Mrs. Norris——”</p>

<p>“Drat Mrs. Norris!” she interrupted. “A man
with only front names can’t have any advantages over
me. You’ll call me Phœbe, young man, as everybody
else does. You don’t suppose I’m goin’ to delay our
intimacy by Misterin’ you, do you?” She turned
abruptly to Jerry. “Just what claims have you on
this beautiful person, Jerry? I want to know at once.
The look of him sets me all a-flutter.”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” laughed Jerry. “But don’t make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
him any vainer, Phœbe. He’s stuffed with pride as
it is.”</p>

<p>“Ach!” Phœbe tossed her head. “I’ll take that out
of him. My method is to puff him full of flattery till
he explodes—feed him till he’s sick of it.”</p>

<p>“If flattery be the food of love, play on,” cried
Richard.</p>

<p>And so they joked and grew acquainted. Amid
interruptions and laughter Jerry managed to piece out
an explanation of her meeting with Richard, of Mrs.
Wells’ interest in him, and of Richard’s plans for the
saving of Walter.</p>

<p>“Poor lad!” Phœbe grew serious. “Walter spent
the night out on this porch just before you sailed. He
had got hold of a quart of whisky somehow and was
beginning on it, but I wheedled it out of him. He was
going to toss it into the Lake, but I tried other tactics
on him. I told him to put it on that shelf up there.”
She pointed to a small projection near the roof of her
small cottage. A brown bottle obviously three-quarters
full was in ample view. “I told him that he must fight
the devil a stand-up fight. He slept out here all night,
and there it is—just as he left it.”</p>

<p>Phœbe might have told more; but she did not. She
was the garrulous sort, the old “sanguine type,” who
keep their own counsel in the midst of much chattering.
She might have told of Walter’s maudlin love-makings;
of his fierce attempts to force Phœbe Norris to run off
and marry him; and of her struggles to keep him from
slipping completely into the wallow. It would have
made a great difference in the theories of both Mrs.
Wells and of Richard if they could have known this side
of the boy. And it would have been another blow to
the mother if she had realized that it was the expert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
management of Phœbe Norris that had kept the boy
straight during his journey abroad, and that the two
lapses, in London and on the steamer, were brought on
by the irritating surveillance of the mother.</p>

<p>Richard was tremendously interested. He probed
Phœbe with questions, but she turned them off adroitly.
When he persisted in asking her where she got her
knowledge of how to treat Walter she explained frankly.</p>

<p>“You see,” she said, “I have served my trade as an
expert attendant upon twisted-minded folks. Perhaps
they have told you, Richard Richard, that Seth, my
husband, was out of his mind the larger part of ten
years. I was his wife as far as the ceremony goes, but,
as everyone knows, I was really only his hired nurse.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he apologized. “Believe me,
I did not mean to probe you——”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” she tossed her head. “There’s not a
thing to be fussy about. Seth was just a man with a
child’s brain. The real Seth, the one I knew, died
before I married him; so I took care of the boy Seth—if
you understand me—gave him his food, bathed him
and put him to bed. When he was too violent I
threatened him with a whip. I struck him only once—when
he gave me that.” She pulled down the collar of
her gown and showed part of a livid scar. “He always
remembered that whiplash and was a good doggie ever
after. Of course I had to watch him when he got into
his fits; but I have had less trouble with bulldogs.
Poor old Seth, I got to be almost fond of him; but he
was just a faithful two-legged animal; there’s nothing
to be sensitive about.”</p>

<p>Again, this was not the whole story, as everyone knew.
Seth Norris had changed from a fine young grape farmer
into a violent crafty brute. Phœbe had mastered him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
with the whip, but she had been forced to barb-wire a
considerable enclosure to keep the lunatic from doing
damage to others. She had made a comfortable house
for him away from her own dwelling, and there he lived
and roamed about within the limits of the barbed fence
in the finest kind of savage contentment. But there
were wild nights when she had no sleep, and there was
more than one struggle before she was sure of her
physical mastery. And yet, except for the scar, which
did not show, she bore not the slightest evidence of her
gruesome experience.</p>

<p>“I’m a widow at twenty-eight, with land of my own
and income enough to buy the winter praties.” She
struck an attitude out of <i>Monte Cristo</i> and exclaimed,
“‘The world is mine!’”</p>

<p>“You must have married young?” Richard persisted.</p>

<p>“Eighteen,” she said. “Seth died this spring. You
don’t suppose I’d wear black, do you? Lord love you!
I ’phoned up all the neighbours when he——”</p>

<p>“She’s just trying to shock you, Richard. Don’t
believe her,” interrupted Jerry.</p>

<p>“Shut up, hussy. And I tried to inveigle them to
come to a wake, but they all had previous engagements.”</p>

<p>“You’re Irish!” Richard guessed.</p>

<p>“Young man,” Phœbe eyed him, “you are too smart
for these parts. You remind me of the wisdom of our
chief-of-police Casey. A German tourist-party motored
into Penn Yan one afternoon and interrogated Casey.
The German said, ‘Bleeze, I sprech not Englisch.
Mine name ist Schmidt. Bleeze, <i>who</i> is Elm Street?’
And Casey looked hard at him and exclaimed, ‘By
Golly, you’re a Dutchman!’ Irish? Of course I’m
Irish——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll enjoy ‘Jawn,’” exclaimed Richard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Mebbe,” said she. “Wait. I’m Irish and I’m
English and I’m Scotch and the Lord knows what else.
How do you expect to keep a strain pure in this country
where everybody pens up together and eats out of the
same dish? It’s hard enough to keep the feathers off
the legs of my white Orpingtons and get any kind of
ribbon at the Yates county fair.”</p>

<p>“She’s strong on chickens, Richard,” said Jerry.
“Look out! She’s awful touchy on white Orpingtons!”</p>

<p>“And so would you be if you paid good money for
the pure stock, penned them in until they couldn’t
breathe, and then watched them grow all kinds of things
on their legs, things that are not in the books. I’ve
only got six clean-legged hens out of a batch of forty.
It gives me the jumps every time I see a dandelion
thistle blow by. Pfitt! Is that one?... Well, what
are you laughing at?”</p>

<p>She had made such a delicious face as she grabbed an
imaginary thistle that laughter was compulsory.</p>

<p>“Sure, and isn’t it the wind that carries the pollen
and spoils your best flowers by mixin’ ’em——”</p>

<p>Jerry screamed at the thought, and covered her face.</p>

<p>“It’s hardly the accepted theory!” roared Richard.</p>

<p>“Well!” Phœbe kept a serious face; “what I’d like
to know is, <i>what</i> put the bad fuzz on my Orpingtons’
legs? Anyhow, I kill every dandelion I see before they
get bloomin’ and gallivantin’ about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re Irish, O.K.,” cried Richard when he had
recovered. “Deliciously Irish.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you you’d love her?” exulted Jerry,
drying her eyes.</p>

<p>“I fear I shall,” said Richard gallantly.</p>

<p>“Fear is the word, me lad,” said Phœbe. “For
Seth’s ‘pen’ is still there for the next one, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
barb-wire, too. It worked so well with himself that I
couldn’t be content with any other system. And the
whip’s on the rack within easy reach. So count your
beads carefully, Richard Richard, and pray to be
delivered from Phœbe Norris.”</p>

<p>“It would just suit him,” said Jerry. “He’s a
professional loafer. He’d just enjoy being fed and
bathed and put to bed.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said she. “He’s that sort, is he! Then I’m
doomed. They’re the kind that get on my soft spot.
All the derelicts in Jerusalem township find my door
somehow, and they know I can’t resist them. Well,
each man to his trade, I suppose. Whenever you’re
ready, Richard Richard, trot into the pen. Shove the
door to; it locks itself.”</p>

<p>On other topics Phœbe was serious enough; but the
moment the subject touched herself she lifted it to
rollicking nonsense. So before they left she spoke a
quiet word or two to Richard.</p>

<p>“I’m interested in Walter,” she said. “Some day
I want to know what you are doing with him.”</p>

<p>He sketched his plan briefly.</p>

<p>“And I want your opinion, too,” he added eagerly.
“You can be a great help, I feel sure.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? I don’t”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>She pondered for a moment and then shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’m telling nothing. I don’t want to put things
into your head. Let me hear what you can do first.
He’s a good boy. It seems a shame to have him go to
the bad.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he will come out all right?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think he’s done for, do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“But you believe there’s a chance, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Y-es,” she admitted reluctantly. “There’s a
chance to save him.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it.” She said nothing. “Please,
do. It may help wonderfully. I must get clues
everywhere.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you this much,” she came to a decision.
“You go on with your theory of boats and racing and
all that. You may succeed. Lord knows I hope so.
If you fail, come to me. I have a theory, too——”</p>

<p>“Why not try yours first?”</p>

<p>“No—oh, no!” she protested. “It wouldn’t work
that way. If you fail—then I’ll try my medicine.
And the best of luck to you, Richard Richard.”</p>

<p>The moaning yelp of a dog on the scent broke into
the conversation.</p>

<p>“That’s ‘Count’!” said Jerry. “He’s after me.
Someone must have let him loose.” The baying broke
forth near at hand. There was a terrific swish of
nearby bushes, then a huge liver-and-white pointer
nosed into the cottage and leaped upon Jerry, whining
and talking frantically. She had to beat him down.</p>

<p>“Charge!” she called again before he dropped at her
feet and half chewed at her moccasins.</p>

<p>“Why, I believe the pup is crying,” said Phœbe. It
seemed so. His brown eyes looked pathetically tearful.</p>

<p>Jerry knelt beside him, stroked his head, talked
baby-talk to him and let him take her wrist in his big
mouth.</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed of myself, Count,” she purred; “I
never went out to see you after all these weeks away.
Poor old faithful doggie! did he think his muzzer had
left him for good and keeps?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>At the kinder tones he crawled nearer and nearer and
thumped his long tail joyously on the floor; then he
leaped to his feet and tugged at her short skirt, saying
plainly, “Come along home. I’m afraid you’ll get
away again.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go,” Jerry shook her head. “My baby
wants me. Look how he trembles. He just suffers
when I’m away; and here I went and forgot all about
him. You faithful old brute, you make me ashamed.”</p>

<p>She moved out towards the road.</p>

<p>“Are you coming up now, Richard, or do you want
to stay longer and get acquainted with Phœbe?”</p>

<p>Richard was about to speak, but Phœbe forestalled
him.</p>

<p>“Take him with you, Jerry,” she called. “I’m
afraid to be left alone with the man. He has a greedy
look. If he finds out, somehow, that I admire him, the
Lord knows what he might be tempted to do to me—kiss
my hand, probably. Oh, them innocent blue
eyes!” she fell purposely into the colloquial grammar.
“And by the holy cross of Saint Michael, if it isn’t
blushin’ he is! Take him away! I’ll be liftin’ him
into me lap and singin’ him sleepy songs if you leave
him here!”</p>

<p>With much more chatter of the sort, broken into by
replies in the same spirit, Phœbe drove them out.</p>

<p>She stood laughing in the doorway until road trees
hid them; then her face relaxed into uncanny thoughtfulness.
There she stood for some minutes gazing
ahead at nothing at all, and twisting Seth Norris’ gold
band around and around her wedding finger.</p>

<p>Slowly she turned and walked into her garden to the
side farthest from the Lake. A rustic one-and-a-half
story building was before her. The windows were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
numerous but small, exactly arranged so that a man’s
body could not squeeze out. Almost anyone would
have taken the hut for an imitation log cabin, but a
closer view would show that it was built of genuine
logs, huge, heavy fellows that could stand an Indian
siege or, better still, do service as a frontier lock-up.</p>

<p>She unchained the door and stepped inside. It was a
pleasant clean-swept interior. The articles of furniture
were massive, in keeping with the general architecture,
and all were fastened securely.</p>

<p>A farm helper was cradling oats in the field beside
her. When he saw Phœbe’s company depart he had
gone on to the end of his row and then came over the
stile into the garden. He found Mrs. Norris looking
thoughtfully about the log hut.</p>

<p>“I could move the hull thing easy enough,” he took
up the conversation where they had left it a little while
before; “and saw the winders out bigger and put a
porch on this end. The only question is——”</p>

<p>“I’ve changed my mind, Henry,” she interrupted.</p>

<p>“Hey?”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll let it stand where it is for awhile.”</p>

<p>“Y’ll leave it stand, hey?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want any winders cut, the way y’
said?”</p>

<p>“No, Henry, thank you.”</p>

<p>He laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Make a nice rabbit hutch,” he suggested. He knew
that Phœbe was too good a gardener to love rabbits.</p>

<p>“No doubt.” Her mind was not on the man before
her.</p>

<p>“Or perhaps,” Henry was quite ready for a resting
“spell”; cradling oats is not a sinecure. “Or perhaps,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
he speculated more seriously, “you’re thinkin’
o’ raisin’ guineas; they say they’s heaps o’ money in
guineas.”</p>

<p>Phœbe became suddenly aware of Henry.</p>

<p>“No, Henry, not guineas—nothing so useful and
domesticated and industrious as guineas. Breathe it
not to others, Henry; I shall keep this place as a home
for indigent drakes who have lost their pia mater. But
keep it dark, Henry.”</p>

<p>“Hey?” called Henry, to whom all this was dark
enough at the outset. But she had vanished into the
house; and he knew enough of the sting of her Celtic
tongue not to delay longer on the oats.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next morning at breakfast Mrs. Wells capitulated
handsomely.</p>

<p>“Walter,” she smiled towards him beautifully,
“Richard has won your hard-hearted old mother over.
You shall have a yacht, the kind you want, to do with
as you please. I just won’t get used to the fact that
you are grown up. All mothers are that way, I suppose.
So you run along and buy yourself one and win some
of those races the <i>Chronicle’s</i> always talking about.
And you can climb up after peak halyards or birds’-nests
or whatever you want! Geraldine will make you
out a cheque. She’s in full charge of the money now.”</p>

<p>“But, mother——” objected Geraldine, to whom the
new office was a sudden and unexpected promotion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells laughed almost boisterously—a most unusual
performance. Small things had begun to amuse
her out of all proportion to their entertaining powers.</p>

<p>“No ‘buts,’ my child,” she began before Geraldine
could voice a further protest. “You’ve just been
elected, and I’ve resigned—or the other way about.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
I’ve plumped everything on the library table—deeds,
bills, mortgages, cheque-books, stock, everything. Look
them over at your leisure, child. Study them out.
You’ll begin to appreciate the work your mother’s done
for you——”</p>

<p>“But I do, mother! I do!” Geraldine protested.
“Of course, if you wish I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Tut! tut! child!” she soothed; “don’t get
frightened. I’ll sign things when you bring them to
me. But I find I need a rest. Little things annoy me.
I want to get free. You don’t know how jolly I felt
the moment I came to that resolution. Really,” she
puffed a little, “I am perceptibly growing stouter!
Expect any minute to see the hooks and eyes start from
their roots!”</p>

<p>Here the laughter verged into happy tears.</p>

<p>Many sobering things had happened to Jerry recently,
but none more serious than this. It was the sudden
abdication of a beneficent monarch, and therefore, to
the crown princess, unbelievable. But it was something
more: it was a strong mother cut down by the
swift approach of old age. Some of the old fear of the
dominant woman lingered in Jerry’s attitude—it never
quite left her—but it was mingled now with pity.
Those puffy cheeks and the simper were ghastly when
one thought of the past years of firm dignity. And a
patch of pure white had appeared beside the grey of her
temples.</p>

<p>Almost as abruptly as the mother had put off her responsibilities
Jerry took them up. As the older woman
had grown child-like, the younger woman had matured.
But Geraldine Wells had always been older in thought
than she ever had expressed in word or action; and now
she quietly assumed her proper years. Richard had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
had a large share in that transforming, but the pitiful
picture of the smiling, contented mother had hastened
the process.</p>

<p>Richard was intent upon Walter; as much as he could
he diverted the boy’s attention from the extraordinary
transfer of authority just being promulgated so carelessly.
It was a great relief to see that Walter’s interest
was in the forthcoming yacht, and not at all in the
change of management of the estate.</p>

<p>Richard got him to tell all over again the fine offer of
Captain Fagner.</p>

<p>“Got a name for it yet?” Richard had then asked.</p>

<p>“Sure!” Walter spoke up guiltily.</p>

<p>“Have you! What’ll you call her?”</p>

<p>“Sago-ye-wat-ha.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, man, what’s that? It sounds like a
curse.”</p>

<p>Jerry had finished the conversation with the mother
by this time.</p>

<p>“That’s Red Jacket’s name in the Seneca language,”
she explained. “Red Jacket was a wonderful orator,
perhaps the greatest Indian orator known in history.
Sago-ye-wat-ha means ‘He keeps them awake.’ Pretty
clever name for a good talker, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” agreed Richard. “And a bully name
for a racing yacht. ‘She keeps them awake’! Good!
Here’s hoping that she also puts them all to sleep!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells, as usual, had her coffee served on the
terrace. Walter was soon making for the Norris
cottage. He half explained as he left that he was going
to sail round the Point in the “cat” and see Fagner
about the new boat. Walter had no money for trolley
fare; and he was never a youngster to take much to
horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“This financial business has unnerved me,” Jerry
confessed when they were alone. “It was a shock.”</p>

<p>“You’ll love it,” Richard commented shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” she corrected his view-point.
“I’m crazy to get into it. I’m not lazy like you.
What worries me is mother. She’s getting sleek and
fat and silly-minded. Did you see the way she
laughed? Like a foolish old woman.... She’s ill.
That collapse on the boat meant more than we thought,
I fear. I think I’ll have Dr. Sampson drop in for a
call. He’s the only man about here who can manage
her and prescribe for her without her ever being aware
of it. Dr. Sampson can laugh a bone into setting
properly, and over the telephone, too!”</p>

<p>“Those Sampsons could always do wonders with
bones,” he joked; “remember the historic jaw-bone?”</p>

<p>He told her not to worry about Mrs. Wells, that she
was going through a very natural transformation.
The old will show age. Jerry must get used to the fact
that her mother was sixty years old in years but nearly
eighty in performance. No doubt the shock had done
its part in making the change abrupt, but there was
nothing alarming. The point was, he insisted, to take
her at her word before she became querulous—age is
not at all consistent; and further, he suggested that
she should see the family lawyer and have papers made
giving Geraldine complete control of everything.</p>

<p>“Why, how absurd!” she began, but he pointed out
to her the consequences to Walter of having an estate
on his hands.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose for one minute that you could
control him?” he asked.</p>

<p>That sobered her.</p>

<p>“I am not thinking of your mother’s death,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
assured her. “She is the type that lives on into a long
peaceful dotage. But I am thinking seriously of what
she might rise up some morning and do, just as she did
this morning. She might hand over the whole thing to
Walter, or present him with a dangerous sum of money.”</p>

<p>“That’s very true,” Jerry agreed. “After this
morning I’ll believe anything of her.”</p>

<p>“See your lawyer without delay,” he repeated.
“There is such a thing as ‘power of attorney,’ I think
they call it. It gives you authority over everything
without having the mother relinquish her title to anything.”</p>

<p>“But she can always withdraw such papers—I
know that much law.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” Richard explained; “but lawyers
know how to delay. What we want to stave off is
any sudden on-the-minute decision.”</p>

<p>Jerry agreed that the idea was a good one. For
her own gain she would not have lifted a finger, but
always Walter was forcing decisions.</p>

<p>“I’m really growing enthusiastic over Walter,” she
remarked abruptly. “He has picked up wonderfully.
Doesn’t it strike you as odd that mother’s complete
surrender and Walter’s change have come about at the
same time?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. It agrees with my theory; and whoever
heard a man going against his own theory? Mrs.
Wells had a sort of mental strangle-hold on Walter’s
mind. I believe that she clutched his mind and held
it as literally as she could have held his wrist. When
she gave up, he was set free. That’s not only my
theory, but it’s the belief of ‘Jawn’ Galloway. Wait
till you see him! He’ll make it clear to you. He’s
coming, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“Oh, is he? No; I didn’t know. Did mother
invite him?”</p>

<p>“Jove!” Richard remembered. “I wrote him that
I was about to ask her; but I clean forgot it. But we
can’t expect him for several days yet. There’ll be
plenty of time to break the news that she has invited
‘Jawn’ up; and when she sees ‘Jawn’ she’ll rejoice.
I’m dying to see Phœbe and ‘Jawn’ get together.
They’re a pair of Irish comedians.... But I’ve good
news for you. Walter declined his nip last night.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>He explained to her his system, backed up by the
authority of the ship doctor, of permitting a small
drink a day to keep down the agonies of thirst.</p>

<p>“Walter refused?” She was incredulous and
happy.</p>

<p>“Absolutely!” cried Richard. “Said he would
have to cut that out now. He said a skipper would
have to keep himself pretty straight if he wanted
to show in a race against men like Fagner and Tyler.
Isn’t it glorious?”</p>

<p>“Glorious?” echoed Jerry, her eyes shining. “It’s—it’s
uncanny.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> took a long part of the morning for Walter’s
“cat” to arrive at Fagner’s dock. The skipper was
in Penn Yan, he was told, at the N. Y. C. tracks,
unloading his new yacht. So more time elapsed before
Walter was able to sail into the Lake “outlet,” tie up,
and saunter over to the scene. Willing helpers enough
were eager to assist in setting the mast, fastening
the stays, adjusting this and that preparatory to
dropping her into the Lake. Walter stood by, too
shy to let them know that the boat was his own.</p>

<p>Finally, just as the last heave dropped her into the
water, where she floated like the proverbial cork,
Fagner noticed Walter.</p>

<p>“We’re getting your boat ready for you,” he chaffed.
He had not the faintest notion that the boy’s talk
at various times was based on anything substantial.
He had joined in with Walter’s scheme out of sympathy
and good nature. Walter’s whole life and future
were an open book to that locality. “Or would you
rather have the <i>Moodiks</i>?”</p>

<p>“This ’un suits me,” Walter remarked. “Whe’ ’re
the sails?”</p>

<p>“They’ll be along later; ordered new ones from
Boston, and they had trouble with a strike down
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>Except for the sails the yacht was complete. The
group on the dock stood off and admired while Fagner
tuned up his motor-boat and arranged a tow-line;
but meanwhile Walter had hauled George Alexander’s
cat-boat alongside and was fastening his own tow-line.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to take him up, Walt?” someone asked.
Unknown to Walter it had been a town joke among
the men that Walter Wells, who never had a cent, had
offered to buy a yacht. Fagner’s offer to sell had been
made in public, but the spirit of the offer was equally
well known.</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Walter.</p>

<p>The operation caught Fagner’s eye, but before
he could say a word Walter dumbfounded him by
remarking, “Jerry’ll send yuh a cheque, soon as you
tell her how much.”</p>

<p>Fagner said nothing, but moved off quickly in
search of a telephone. His smile reassured the crowd,
who began to see now that this was business after all.
They gazed at Walter solemnly, for business is no
joking matter.</p>

<p>At the other end of the telephone Jerry assured the
skipper that the option on his new yacht was being
taken up seriously. He came hurriedly back.</p>

<p>“You really mean to take me up, Walter?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Sure; unless you’ve changed your mind?”</p>

<p>Walter stopped fumbling with his sailor knots and
straightened up. The crowd looked on expectantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Fagner laughed. “I’m game! I said
I’d do it, and I will! But,” he added half to himself,
“this is certainly one on me.” Aloud he asked, “Are
you sure you don’t want the <i>Moodiks</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“Nope,” said Walter, bending to his rope again.</p>

<p>“Well, let me tow you down with my motor?”</p>

<p>“Nope,” said Walter. “I’ll tow her myself.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the little “cat” was heading
down the Lake with the new yacht in tow.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” someone asked Fagner.
“You look as if you’d lost something.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” laughed Fagner. “I’ve only just been
‘called’ with four mixed diamonds and one black
card.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you want to sell to the boy?” asked one of
his workmen, a good old fellow to whom one could be
confidential.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Fagner. “Want to sell that?”
He pointed to the beautiful fragile craft which a
moment or two before had been his. It was following
the “cat” as if it had no weight at all. “Absolutely
not! That little beauty is the fastest sailing boat in
America. Do you see the way she glides? That boat
slips over the water like a skimming stone. But she’ll
have to be skippered,” he smiled grimly. “After he
loses a few races I’ll buy her back. I agreed to sell him
either boat, provided he would skipper it himself, and
provided also that he would give me an option on a resell.
I think I’m safe—although I feel just now like a
kid that has had his candy snatched out of his hand.”</p>

<p>Jerry, in the meantime, was busy with the documents
piled up on the library table. There had been order
about them once, but it took time to discover which
were out of date and which still operative. Careful
memoranda on slips of cardboard were helpful here and
there, but it would require reading packets of correspondence
before all the matters could be cleared up;
and George Alexander would have to be interviewed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
George Alexander had had complete charge of the
house and farm end of things during the trip abroad.</p>

<p>This left Richard to his own devices. For a time he
made quick friends with “Count”—pointers are not
very discriminating. Then with the dog “heeling”
beautifully, he marched down the hill to take a swim.
Phœbe Norris was sewing on her water-front porch.</p>

<p>“I came down for a swim if I——”</p>

<p>“Prevaricator!” she remarked pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Jove! You’re right,” he exclaimed. “It’s you
I’m after comin’ to see! There’s heaps I want to tell
you.”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” she jabbed a needle at a chair, “and get
it off your chest.”</p>

<p>He told her about Walter from the time of his first
acquaintance with him in the smoker of the <i>Victoria</i>—omitting,
of course, the real facts about his own change
of name—up to the latest incident of the refusal of his
daily “nip.” Then he related the astonishing transformation
in Mrs. Wells, her sudden taking on of the
privileges of age, ending with her placing Jerry in
charge of the Wells finances.</p>

<p>“The Wells seem prosperous,” he half inquired.</p>

<p>“They are,” Phœbe answered; “they have six
hundred acres, mostly under cultivation. The vineyards
are especially profitable. The negroes under George
Alexander manage the place excellently. Besides, they
have a lot of money invested in mortgages and wine
stocks. It’s a perfectly safe investment, young man.
Don’t be afraid to commit yourself.”</p>

<p>Phœbe Norris was notoriously direct, but the point
seemed to slip by Richard.</p>

<p>“Then there’s all the more reason for Jerry to get
legal control.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“And why, pray?”</p>

<p>He explained the danger that might suddenly loom
up with the transfer of the property to Walter.</p>

<p>“You are tremendously interested in Walter.
You’re not thinking of marryin’ Walter, are you?”</p>

<p>“Jove, no! I’m not thinking of marrying anybody.
What has that to do with the case?”</p>

<p>“You seem to be sensible enough,” she looked at him
critically. “But,” she sighed, “you never can tell.
Lots of times you would have sworn, now, that Seth was
as whole-minded as that sleepin’ pup.” “Count” had
flopped at Richard’s feet. “But all the while he was
probably undecided whether to try the axe on me or the
bread knife.”</p>

<p>“I give up,” Richard cried, as a child might at a
hard riddle, “what’s the answer?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” she nodded towards the log hut in the
garden, “there’s always the ‘pen’ as a last resort.
I’ll keep it open for you. But not bein’ married to you
I promise to knock you on the head if you grow violent.”</p>

<p>He must have missed the point of some remark, he
thought. Or could long association with a madman
have given her an unsteady turn herself? He wondered.</p>

<p>“You see, can’t you,” he began again, “that Mrs.
Wells might put it in Walter’s power to——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! yes!” she interrupted impatiently. “I’m
not a bat. I see that. Go on with the next instalment.”
And she went on with her sewing.</p>

<p>“So I suggested that Jerry have the mother give her
a ‘power of attorney’ to manage the estate.”</p>

<p>Phœbe dropped her sewing in her lap. “And what
would a girl like Jerry be doing with all that business
to look after?”</p>

<p>“She could do it. She’d like that sort of thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Is Mrs. Wells out of her mind completely?”</p>

<p>“No. But she’s losing her grip more than you’d
believe. You should see her. Her very face has
changed. We don’t want her——”</p>

<p>“<i>We</i> don’t—who’s ‘we’?”</p>

<p>“Jerry and I—we both feel that the whole thing
will be safer if Jerry has legal rights. Of course, if
the boy were fit, there would not be the slightest
objection to turning over the management to him.”</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t object to that?”</p>

<p>“Not a particle—if he were capable.”</p>

<p>Again Phœbe scrutinized the man before her.</p>

<p>“That ‘power of attorney’ is a very clever idea,”
she remarked. “Who thought that all out?”</p>

<p>“I did,” he admitted. “I’m not sure if it will
work——”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll work all right, young man; and you know
it well enough. You’re just modest, that’s all.”</p>

<p>He asked her abruptly what she meant. She replied,
“I’m Irish and I’m also Scotch; so let me give you a
Scotch answer, by asking you what <i>you</i> mean. You’re
not featherin’ a soft nest for yourself, perhaps?” She
flung a hand towards the Wells’ house.</p>

<p>Richard looked out into the Lake, but made no answer
at all. For the first time in many weeks Richard
Richard became his old self, shy and silent. His ears
glowed; he became uncomfortable and awkward, as
self-conscious persons will; and the gates of his fluency
closed. It had been pleasant, this new life of his, and
his instinct told him it was good; but now another
instinct warned him that it might not be wholly good.
Phœbe’s cold interrogations had given him first a vague<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
uneasiness and then alarm. Her mind was distinctly
not friendly. He felt it, or rather, the sensitive antennæ
of his mind caught the vibrations and warned him that
he had been out of his shell quite long enough.</p>

<p>Perhaps they sat for ten minutes in tableau, she
sewing and he gazing out into the Lake. The dog,
“Count,” added to the picture by resting a rigid head
on two outstretched paws.</p>

<p>“Smoke, if you want to,” Phœbe suggested finally.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said; but he did not smoke.</p>

<p>This man exhibited all the symptoms of guilt, but,
somehow, he did not act the convincing villain. And
yet had not everything pointed to the rôle? A casual
visit to either Sampson’s or Cornwell’s moving-picture
theatres would have convinced anyone: handsome man;
no particular occupation; also no money; acquaintance
made by accident; handsome girl; rich mother growing
feeble and trusting. All the characters were here, including
the clever Irish girl whose keen wit rescues the
tottering family. “But, hang it all,” thought Phœbe,
“why do I feel so mean about it? I ought to feel
heroic (or is it heroinic?) and flushed with righteousness.
But I don’t. I feel like a criminal myself.”</p>

<p>Other minutes passed by, but Richard seemed not to
note them. “I wish I could talk,” he was saying to
himself. “This infirmity of mine is like an epileptic
fit where one knows all that is happening about him
but can give no sign. And I thought I had got rid of
it up in this fine country.” But he said not a word.</p>

<p>“<i>Chills and fever!</i>” Phœbe suddenly stamped her
foot and shook her red hair at him. “Aren’t you ever
goin’ to speak again?”</p>

<p>“Count” leaped to his feet, yelped suddenly, and
started about the room, his nose to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Glory be!” laughed Phœbe. “He thought I was a
gun flying off. The same I was. I couldn’t keep still
that long again without explodin’. You go take a bath,
young man. You’ll feel better. You’ll find the same
suit dried out and hangin’ up in the room on the right.
Go take a swim and then come up here, and we’ll get
things straightened out.”</p>

<p>He rose and went towards the little room, but he
said nothing. A nod of his head seemed to be enough,
and a kindly smile expressed acquiescence.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t make a good lady detective,” sighed
Phœbe. If the villain was fine and good-looking, she
thought, and gazed afar off across the water with mild,
blue eyes—ach! she would be pounding away at his
chains with a saw and a jimmy and inventing ways of
escape from the lock-up. Her heart was too soft for
that business. Well! she could keep her eye open, at
any rate. Even if she had lived in the country all her
life she knew a thing or two, the which Handsome
Harrys might find out. What was the use of subscribing
yearly to the <i>New York Times</i> if it wasn’t to
give you a vicarious experience of the ways of the
world?</p>

<p>As Richard passed her he stooped for a moment to
examine her sewing—something or other the largest
ingredient of which seemed to be lace—looked straight
into her face, gently, almost boyishly shy, and then
without a word walked out to the end of the little
dock. He dived immediately and struck out at a
diagonal for the farther shore.</p>

<p>Occasionally Phœbe looked up to note the receding
figure. When about the middle of the Lake she saw
him turn and make straight out towards the main
branch. It may be remembered that Lake Keuka is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
shaped like a mitten with a very large thumb. Mrs.
Norris’ cottage was at the tip-end of the thumb. Towards
the rest of the “hand” Richard swam, a distance
of over two miles. Soon he was not discernible, except
through Phœbe’s fine field-glass, wherein he could be
observed swimming a long steady stroke.</p>

<p>“The villain escapes by swimming the Lake,” Phœbe
chuckled. “Sure it’s a fine movie actor he’d make.”
She sewed on thoughtfully for a minute or two and then
added, “Well, if he doesn’t come back it’s a good
bargain I’ve made swapping Seth’s cotton bathing togs
for an all-wool Norfolk suit.”</p>

<p>The cool refreshing water was as balm to the troubled
“villain.” As the world judged matters he knew he
was a failure; but generally he was strong enough to
ignore the world and live his individual life. Often,
however, the constant pressure of inquiry or of accusation—the
world will harry you if you do not conform,
as all martyrs will testify—had their cumulative effect
of inducing depression. It was only by vigorous open-air
exercise or the summoning of all his will that he was
able to stand erect and unshaken. The waters of Lake
Keuka were tonic to the will. As he plied on, his spirits
rose. He saw the law of his own life clearer; he resolved
to be true to nothing but himself. His shyness
waned and vanished, and strength came. “Resolve to
be thyself,” he quoted, “and know that he who finds
himself loses his misery.”</p>

<p>Bluff Point began to loom on his left as he passed out
of the “thumb” and got out into the main branch, here
over a mile wide. The Point was a sheer rise out of the
water of almost a thousand feet, and it towered like a
huge mountain. He turned about and faced north in
order to get a better view of the Point, and became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
aware of a familiar cat-boat tacking across in front
of him.</p>

<p>It had in tow a stately little yacht, looking without
sails like the skeleton of a spectre sloop.</p>

<p>“Ahoy! Captain Wells, ahoy!” he called.</p>

<p>Walter saw him and came about. In a few minutes
of manœuvering the two men were jabbering over the
beauties of <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i>. Richard had found his
voice again.</p>

<p>It was long after the noon hour when they tied up at
Phœbe Norris’ dock. Phœbe was not at home. She
had found it impossible to sit and sew as she had
planned. She could not decide whether she were suffering
from a guilty conscience or a desire to gad; at any
rate she concluded that Richard’s silence had put a spell
on her cabin for the afternoon. Gathering up the sewing
material, she called to “Count,” who was trying to
stir up a rabbit among her cabbages, and plodded up
the hill to the “Big House,” as the negroes called the
Wells’ dwelling.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the drive she came upon a fattish
young man, fairly well dressed—clean, at least, she said
to herself—and evidently from the Big City.</p>

<p>He turned a broad Irish face upon her and opened a
mouth which exposed large irregular teeth. Her father
had such a face, she remembered distinctly, and just
such great white teeth.</p>

<p>“Is it Mrs. Emma Wells I see before me?” He
raised his hat and bowed like a Dublin ballad
vender.</p>

<p>“As Mrs. Emma Wells is sixty years old,” Phœbe
retorted, “it’s blind your eyes must be.”</p>

<p>“Blinded by the glamour of the sun on your——”</p>

<p>“Red head,” she helped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“On your saffron locks,” he went on, “and by the
charm of your sweet face.”</p>

<p>“Blarney!” she retorted. “Who are you that’s
wantin’ to see Mrs. Emma Wells?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he put a long finger to the side of his nose.
“I divulge nothing. I don’t know who I am till I’ve
seen my confederate, Mr. Dick.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your grip?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Grip?”</p>

<p>“Yes, grip—bag, carry-all, Gladstone, suitcase?—the
thing you carry your sample books in. But you’d
better be makin’ off. Mrs. Wells has all the encyclopedias,
handy books of information and guide books she’ll
need this side of Paradise.”</p>

<p>“But it’s a visit I’m making,” said he.</p>

<p>“You wrote your own invitation, then,” said she.</p>

<p>While they talked so tartly at each other they walked
along up the drive and grinned with enjoyment. Only
the Celt can understand that this sort of palaver is the
salt of living.</p>

<p>“Wrote my own invitation? Indeed I did not,” he
insisted. “The lady of the house herself it was who
sent me the invitation by my very dear friend, Mr. Dick.
You don’t know Mr. Dick?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” he ruminated. “I should think all the
housemaids would be knowing him by this time. He’s
the handsome one! But perhaps with all your time
taken up in the kitchen——”</p>

<p>For that he received a sounding thwack on the side of
the face.</p>

<p>“Holy Michael!” he started back. “If it isn’t my
mother’s old fraternity grip you’re giving me! Shake
hands! I didn’t know you were Irish till that minute.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Shake hands with a compatriot, and forgive me for
taking you for aught save a princess. Of course I knew
who you were all the while. It’s the handsome Miss
Wells that Mr. Dick’s so full of, the heiress; only he
should have said a word about the glory of your hair.
Never a word he said.”</p>

<p>“Who is this Mr. Dick?” she asked as they walked
up the steps.</p>

<p>“How can I know till I have a chat with him?” he
returned. “Our stories must agree, you know.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure his name is Dick?”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” he stopped and pondered, “now that
you’ve put the doubt in my head, I’m not so sure.
I’ve lost the letter that tells me all about it. I think
he said his name was Mr. Dick. Sure, it was. Dick?
Of course it was Dick. What do you mean by confusing
my mind over the name of my oldest and dearest
friend?”</p>

<p>“And what might your name be?”</p>

<p>They had arrived at the house.</p>

<p>“‘Jawn,’” he said.</p>

<p>“‘Jawn’ what?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to consider,” he smiled knowingly. “No
doubt Mr. Dick has arranged all that. I mustn’t
commit myself just yet. For the time being you may
call me ‘Jawn.’”</p>

<p>Phœbe darted suddenly to this side of the big porch
and then to the other, looking carefully about the
central pillars, “Non” and “Da,” all to induce
“Jawn” to inquire the reason, as he well knew.</p>

<p>“What’s the game?” he asked. “Solitaire hide-and-seek?”</p>

<p>“I’m lookin’ for the man with the box?” she said;
“the one that grinds out the pictures. Maybe you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
don’t know it, young man, but we’re both of us in a
moving-picture story. One villain has just escaped by
swimming the Lake; another—that’s you—comes up
with an assumed name; mistakes me first for the cook
and then for the heiress and is about to enter and make
off with the family jewels. If a fillum man doesn’t get
this he’s missin’ a good story. But come in! And
wipe your feet on that mat! Your heart may be black”—the
two good-natured faces fairly beamed at each
other, belying any literal meaning in the words—“but
that’s the Lord’s business. At least I can see to it that
your feet are clean.”</p>

<p>These were two different types of American Irish.
“Jawn” was the pure breed, one generation out of
the peat-bogs, but speeded forward a thousand years
by the magic of America; Phœbe was the refined gold
of the Celt untarnished by a dozen strains of alien blood.
But they were playboys, both of them. A fantastic
attitude towards the world was to them more serious and
important than all the workaday habits of smug other-peoples.
They came of a race who have the saddest
thoughts on the ineffectiveness of living, and present the
gayest face to the whole dull business. And both were
on a holiday, “Jawn” freed from the psychological
clinic, and Phœbe fluttering with unaccustomed wings
after ten years of captivity.</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried “Jawn,” suspending operations on
the mat. “I feel a limerick coming! It’s a disease.”
He mumbled and rolled his eyes, then brightened up as
the rhymes came out properly.</p>

<p>One glance at Phœbe’s illuminated face would be convincing
enough that she was enjoying hugely this bit of
impromptu and apropos doggerel. But she shook her
head dolorously and sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“It is sure a disease,” she said; “are you taken often
with the fit?”</p>

<p>“It’s the air,” he explained as they entered the open
door and walked through the entrance-hall and turned
into the library. Jerry had taken her documents to her
room, and Mrs. Wells was busy among the perennials.
“I felt it coming on me the moment I got a
sniff of the waters of Lake Keuka. It’s like hay-fever,
you know.” They seated themselves in the
library.</p>

<p>There have been waves of limericks in America, but
it is questionable if the loping doggerel will ever go
quite out of style. The Irish never tire of the monotonous
rhythm. In the twilight summer evenings
along the hedges, or in winter around the huge kitchen
fire, the young Irish lad is for ever contributing impromptu
limericks. The verses are usually of a low tone
morally, and so local in their application that the
stranger needs much explanation, but their popularity
is perennial. Jawn had his gift straight from the
father, but the son had raised them a tone or two to fit
American taste.</p>

<p>Jawn’s bad lines were covered by exquisite acting.
The purse of the lip, the ecstatic roll of the eye, and the
sudden flash of big teeth—these were enough to bring
laughter to the face of his most superior critic. So
Phœbe was compelled to break through a forced reserve
and let her own laughter loose. And hers was of the
vaulting kind.</p>

<p>“Go on with you, man!” she cried. “It’s a movie
actor you’d make with that face! And what was your
next fit like?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells, with a great bunch of phlox, was
entering the rear hall when “Jawn” began; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
came to the door of the library in time to hear the
conclusion.</p>

<p>Jawn was a good fellow and an expert psychologist,
but, alas, his humour was not always refined. He took a
huge interest in the rough side of life, wherein he was
not only true to type but true to his early training on
the West Side. The Celtic flavour saved the dish, however.
And he never went beyond the bounds set by
his instinctively good sense.</p>

<p>Phœbe, who secretly loved many of those proper
coarse things of life on which a Puritan world has set a
superstitious taboo, mingled her shrill peal with Jawn’s
heavy laughter when Mrs. Wells appeared.</p>

<p>It was the first time Phœbe had seen Mrs. Wells since
her return from abroad, and although she had been prepared
in advance she was not ready for the extraordinary
physical transformation. Mrs. Wells was not only greyer,
but she had grown puffy and weak; an amiable softness
had settled in her eyes and in the lines about the mouth.
But Phœbe covered her surprise in effusive greetings.</p>

<p>“Phœbe!” Mrs. Wells had exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Mother Wells!” Phœbe had shrilled, a pet name,
the private privilege of Phœbe.</p>

<p>“Phœbe,” thought Jawn; “it is the daughter’s
name; and I figured it was Geraldine. My memory is
gone entirely.”</p>

<p>The greetings over, Mrs. Wells waited patiently for
some explanation of the smiling visitor. Evidently,
from the uproarious conversation she had interrupted,
these two were well-enough acquainted.</p>

<p>“Who is—your—uh——?” Mrs. Wells helped.</p>

<p>“He’s not my anything,” retorted Phœbe. “I
haven’t the least idea who he is; and he doesn’t seem
to have clear ideas on the subject himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“This is Mrs. Emma Wells?” Jawn was presenting
a hand and his widest smile.</p>

<p>“Ye-s,” Mrs. Wells admitted, on her guard instantly.
“If you came about mortgages or business you’ll have
to see my daughter Geraldine. She is upstairs in her
room. Shall I send for her?”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you expecting me?” Jawn asked.</p>

<p>“No-o; I think not.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Dick said you had invited me to pay you a
visit.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dick? I don’t know any Mr. Dick, unless you
mean Mr. Dickson? He lives across the Lake.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t anyone tell you to expect ‘Jawn’
Galloway?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He’s forgot it!”</p>

<p>“Please let me send for Jerry,” Mrs. Wells suggested
nervously. “Please——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have nothing to do with business.” He
waved a large palm. “I’m just a guest.”</p>

<p>“Your name, you said——” Mrs. Wells tried to clear
the mystery.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t said, have I?” he asked blandly.</p>

<p>Phœbe broke in. “You have; you just asked us if
we weren’t expecting a ‘Jawn’ Galloway?”</p>

<p>“I did,” he nodded; “but by the same token that’s
not saying ‘Jawn’ Galloway’s my name.”</p>

<p>“I think,” Phœbe remarked emphatically, “we had
better ’phone for Casey—Casey is the police force, Mr.
‘Jawn’—and have done with it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells told the visitor not to mind Mrs. Norris,
and explained how she always said the opposite of what
she really meant. But she was puzzled, and plainly
showed it. Once or twice she started towards the door.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
It would be such a relief to turn the matter over to
Geraldine. Meanwhile “Jawn” Galloway was carried
away by the thought of getting rid of his plain Irish
name. Evidently his good pal, “Mr. Dick”—if that
was the name he had taken—had forgotten to mention
“Jawn” Galloway at all. That was thoroughly characteristic
of “Mr. Dick.” Well, why not play his own
game and adopt a fancy cognomen, too? Professor
“Jawn” Galloway was getting too well known, anyway.
He couldn’t walk down the street without someone
consulting him on some sort of mental upset. After an
article of his in a popular magazine his friends had
been calling him up of a morning to get his interpretation
of their dreams of the night before. “Jawn” he
would have to stick to, for he had admitted as much to
this red-headed daughter, who had started out Geraldine
and had turned into Phœbe and then into Mrs. Norris.
Besides he never could get used to any other first name.
“Dalrymple”—that sounded distinguished and upper-class
or—ah! he had it—“De Lancey!”</p>

<p>“But if you would tell us your name,” Mrs. Wells
was saying gently, “I am sure we could then understand—ah!
here’s Geraldine!” Mrs. Wells was radiantly
relieved.</p>

<p>In a word she put the mystery to Jerry, who understood
immediately. It was “Jawn” Galloway, and she
came forward with outstretched hand, intending to
explain. But “Jawn” was on his feet and reaching
out his own hand.</p>

<p>“Jerry!” he called. “I’m betting that this is the
Jerry my good friend has been writing to me about.
Only he didn’t have ink vivid enough,” he shook her
hand warmly. “It is Jerry, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Well, I’m ‘Jawn’ De Lancey.”</p>

<p>“De Lancey?” she looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“Didn’t Mr. Dick tell you?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dick. Do you mean Mr. Richard?”</p>

<p>He laughed, throwing back his head.</p>

<p>“We all call him Mr. Dick in New York. Of course,
you would not know that. Mr. Richard! How stupid
of me. Mr. Richard, of course.”</p>

<p>Explanations followed, Jerry looming large as an
explainer; but Phœbe was plainly unconvinced.</p>

<p>“I still insist,” she was firm, “upon calling Casey.
But first I would count the silver.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>THE LADY DETECTIVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Any</span> friend of Mr. Richard’s was welcome to “Red
Jacket,” Mrs. Wells assured Jawn; and no questions
asked; one could never tell when Phœbe Norris was
joking and when she was serious; Phœbe Norris herself
was never quite certain. When Mrs. Wells remonstrated
mildly at her too inquisitive questions on Jawn’s
past, Phœbe puzzled Mrs. Wells still further by remarking,
“But I must act up to me part of lady detective,
mustn’t I? It’s a movie play we’re in. The man with
the box is concealed somewhere about, I’m sure. We’ll
see the whole thing some evening at Cornwall’s Theatre,
I’ll warrant ye!”</p>

<p>“All the world’s a movie,” agreed Jawn, “and men
and women merely——”</p>

<p>“Merely fillum,” Phœbe shot in her interruption.
“Some bein’ hair-breadth horrors and some, like you,
Jawn, bein’ just ‘comics.’”</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Jawn, striking an attitude.</p>

<p>“He’s got a limerick in him!” shouted Phœbe.
“Hush!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells was disturbed. “He’s got a what?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Limerick!” cried Phœbe; “it’s kind of fit!”</p>

<p>“Shan’t I get a glass of water?” Mrs. Wells rose
timorously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>Phœbe’s laughter pealed again. “No!” she said.
“Would you quench the fire of divine doggerel?”</p>

<p>Jawn minded them not at all. His eye was fixed on
distance and his hand waved gently and his lips moved.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells was not quite assured of the humour of
the lines, but she found herself laughing with the others
at the droll face of the reciter. He seemed a pleasant
sort of man, although his laugh was rather startling.
But he was a friend of Richard’s; that was enough to
assure her; so he was invited to become a guest at
“Red Jacket.”</p>

<p>It was a relief to know that he had not called on
business connected with the estate. Since the return
from Europe Mrs. Wells had found it impossible to
focus her mind upon the financial end of her household
affairs. Never before had she realized how complicated
everything was. Not that she had ever conceived her
task to be easy; but she had always been able heretofore
to summon her will to the problem, and like an almost
impossible puzzle, the answer had come out eventually.
One had only to persist, she always told herself. If
interest on mortgages was due and the bank balance
was needed to pay off the vineyard helpers, there was
always a new loan on this or that stock; and if the
bills for last year’s grape baskets or this year’s spraying
and willow-wiring became too accumulative, one could
hypothecate the wine stock or sell a parcel of orchard
land or—many things that a resourceful business woman
could think of.</p>

<p>Naturally her bookkeeping had assumed an Egyptian
character; a private sign here and there, a subtraction
indicated without a balance being drawn, a borrowing
from this page not paid over to the other page—in
short, a system that amounted to a code understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
solely by Mrs. Wells. And not always to Mrs. Wells
was the code instantly clear. There were days when
she puzzled over the meaning of this or that entry;
and sometimes surprising cheques were received on
accounts which she had scored off as settled, and even
more surprising bills were presented whose existence
had faded from her memory. Concentration had always
opened a way of at least temporary escape; but the
mental lassitude which had seized her since her return
from abroad had made concentration impossible. Even
the thought of the figures was terrifying.</p>

<p>There had been strange visitors several times during
the previous eight or ten years, men representing corporations
with which she had had dealings on matters
of mortgages and loans. They had been very pleasant
fellows, just like Jawn, only not so boisterous and self-assured;
and always she had needed her strength to
meet all their exacting requirements. When certain
recent polite letters had assured her that it was about
time for one to appear, then it was that she had decided
to surrender unconditionally and let her healthy grown-up
daughter do the worrying.</p>

<p>When the luncheon-gong sounded Phœbe prepared
to stay on without question. George Alexander always
looked about him before he set the places, and the
presence of Phœbe before a meal always meant a place
for her. Besides, she announced that Jawn had to be
watched.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard’s non-appearance had been explained
by Phœbe.</p>

<p>“I was talkin’ nice and pretty to him,” she said,
“askin’ him if he thought we’d ever have rain, and all
of a sudden he gets displeased and wouldn’t speak to
me at all—just sulked, he did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“That’s—uh—that’s Richard all right,” said Jawn.
“He’s the champion sulker in New York city. I’ve
known him to sit for six evenings in a row and never
give anybody the gift of a word.”</p>

<p>“On board the <i>Victoria</i> he was that way, too,” Jerry
corroborated.</p>

<p>“I never noticed it,” said Mrs. Wells.</p>

<p>“I mean all day on the way from Genoa to Naples,”
Jerry hastened to explain.</p>

<p>“Why, child,” Mrs. Wells remembered, “you did
not meet him until the Captain introduced you at
Naples!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” cried Phœbe, “more conspiracies for
the movie man! Before she met him she had met him
all day long, and when he talked to her he didn’t say a
word! Doesn’t that strike you as about the time to
have another fit, Jawn? It ought to begin:</p>

<p class="center">‘There was a young lady from Naples——’”</p>

<p>“Wait!” Jawn raised a warning finger.</p>

<p>“Wait yourself!” retorted Phœbe, raising a finger,
too. “‘There was a young lady from Naples——’ faples,
saples, daples, raples, japles—ding it! There ain’t no
more rhymes for Naples!”</p>

<p>Jawn was not disturbed, although the evident intention
was to clip his budding limerick. When she had
quite finished he nodded his head and gave her a
limerick with a sufficiency of proper rhymes for
“Naples.”</p>

<p>Jerry was not pressed for explanation of her statement
concerning the habits of Richard before she had
met him. Jawn’s limericks drew attention away from
her, and as the luncheon progressed Phœbe noted the
far-off approach of the cat-boat with its yacht in tow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
From the dining-room the Lake was in full view. And
Jerry remembered her telephone communication with
Fagner, and explained the purpose of the new yacht.
But before luncheon was over Jerry managed to get
Jawn to herself.</p>

<p>“Why do you confuse us by taking a strange name?”
she asked. “You are really Professor John Galloway,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“It’s all the style!” he told her. “Your Mr.
Richard took a fancy name and he gave me the idea.
What’s wrong with John De Lancey? I’m enjoying
it. Already I feel like an aristocrat. Your Richard
writes me that the new name has made a complete
change in his personality. As a psychologist that
interests me, so I’m trying it out. I hope to get a new
personality, too; you don’t know how tired I am of the
old one.”</p>

<p>She had spent the morning upstairs in a fruitless
endeavour to get some sense out of the tangle of
domestic accounts. There were some worrisome entries
in the books, and naturally she was not in the spirit to
comprehend Jawn’s humour to the full.</p>

<p>“I fear it will do harm if mother discovers we are all
hoaxing her,” she told him.</p>

<p>“She’ll enjoy it,” he insisted. The mother was
laughing immoderately at some witticism from Phœbe
Norris. “Trust me to clear everything up when the
time comes. I’ll study out some special limericks for
the occasion. Anyone can see that she is a born lover
of limericks. But tell me, how did Mr. Richard become
Mr. Richard?”</p>

<p>She explained the beginnings of the incognito and
let him understand that she was sorry the innocent
lark had developed so far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Of course you know who he really is,” he said.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What?” he cried, and was about to explain, but
she stopped him.</p>

<p>“Richard must make his own explanations,” she
declared. “It would seem like probing; and he is our
guest, you know.”</p>

<p>She tried to get him to talk about Walter, but he
was very frank in saying that that was Richard’s case.</p>

<p>“But he asked you to come here solely to consult
you about Walter.”</p>

<p>It might be, Jawn agreed; but he was on a vacation.
It was all guess-work anyway, he assured her; and any
man’s guess was as good as another’s. When Richard
got going on a thing he could be guaranteed to put
genius into it.</p>

<p>The young lady before him appealed more to his
interest; and he was not slow in indicating as much.
He quoted what he could remember of Richard’s letter
to prove that it was Jerry and not Walter that had
induced him to come to “Red Jacket.” There was
enough chaffing in his tone to cover up the bluntness
of his statements, but there was no doubt as to his
meaning.</p>

<p>There are many ways to meet this sort of gallantry.
Some women affect indifference and grow stupidly reserved—they
are the ones hit hardest!—and some
simper and pretend that they do not understand; but a
wiser group admit everything and bring the game right
out in the open, where it quickly perishes for lack of
pursuit.</p>

<p>“That was quite right of Richard,” Jerry returned.
“Naturally he would recommend me first, but at that
time, you know, he had not seen Phœbe Norris.” She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
explained Phœbe’s widowhood and enlarged upon her
qualities. “Phœbe will just suit you,” she concluded,
and her good-humoured tone turned all Jawn’s blarneying
back on him and made Jerry herself more reserved
and unapproachable than ever.</p>

<p>Jawn made a wry face.</p>

<p>“Never!” he whispered, like a stage-aside. “There’s
nothing mysterious and romantic in Phœbe to me.
We Irish understand one another too well. I know
every twist in her head, and she’s on to me, every curve
of me. All my charms would be jokes to her; it would
be carrying coals to Newcastle with a vengeance. No!
the Irish get along best with aliens. In Ireland my
father was a subservient peat digger; in America he
became instantly an eccentric genius, a man of parts,
a West Side statesman and diplomat. The big-wigs in
politics consult him now, and his sayings are quoted by
the newspaper ‘columnists’; in Ireland he was just like
thousands of others. No! Phœbe and I suspect each
other already. The feud is on.”</p>

<p>“She seemed to enjoy your verses.”</p>

<p>“Pure bluff to put me off my guard,” he averred.
“We’re like a pair of beggars knocking at the same gate.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>She was amused at his obvious humour, and interested;
proving his point, he told her, that the alien
would love him better than the native.</p>

<p>“How so?” he repeated. “Well, she was the
clever, unusual one before I came. Isn’t it true? I
see it is. Now I’m proving how easy is all that so-called
Irish wit.”</p>

<p>“I’m listenin’, Jawn de Lancey Gallagher,” Phœbe
leaned her red head far over the table. “But don’t
tempt me to punish you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Maybe I might,” said he, “if I knew the penalty.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she considered, “fight fair, or I may be
tempted to go to extremes.”</p>

<p>“And what’d that be?”</p>

<p>“Marry you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Mother of John!” he cried. “Not in America,
lass! It’s forbid by the Constitution.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“It’s the law of the land that prohibits cruel and
unjust punishments.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” she recovered quickly, “but for the
minute I wasn’t thinkin’ of myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” he cried, acknowledging the hit.</p>

<p>“It <i>would</i> be a kind of slow female suicide, now
wouldn’t it, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad definition of marriage,” commented
Jerry thoughtfully; “at least in the majority
of cases that we see about us.”</p>

<p>“What’s a good definition of marriage?” inquired
Jawn.</p>

<p>“A kind of slow female suicide.”</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” cried Jawn. “They’re both
against me! I’m in the lair of the professional man-hater.
Which leads me to ask a connundrum——”</p>

<p>“Do you think this is a children’s party, Jawn
de Lancey McGinnis?” snapped Phœbe.</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it?” he stared about him. “Sure we’re
all kids here. Look at Mrs. Wells.” Mrs. Wells was
ready to laugh before the connundrum was even proposed,
and that sudden touch sent her off. “And look at
that grey-haired old kid over there!” Black George
Alexander, hovering at the door, broke into African
cackles. Jawn’s huge face had the native comedian
power; wherever he turned it laughter sprang, except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
in one quarter. Phœbe Norris looked straight at him
with face set and cold.</p>

<p>“Go on with your connundrum, man,” she commanded
icily.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, evidently shifting his original plan,
“why is Mrs. Phœbe Norris’ face like—like—like the
Tombs of the Pharaohs?”</p>

<p>Phœbe’s face, in turn, became the instigator to mirth.
If it had been stony before, it grew steadily now into
a veritable sphinx. Comment and inquiry could not
dislodge her external claim.</p>

<p>“Why?” inquired Mrs. Wells; she was rather fond
of connundrums, intelligent ones like this one, which
brought in one’s knowledge of ancient history. “Why
is Phœbe’s face like the Tombs of the Pharaohs?”</p>

<p>“The Lord only knows why,” said John solemnly;
“but like the Tombs of the Pharaohs it is.”</p>

<p>A crinkle came to Phœbe’s eyes, and her mouth
quivered.</p>

<p>“I’m not laughin’,” she insisted. “My face
slipped.”</p>

<p>“And is there no other answer?” inquired Mrs.
Wells.</p>

<p>“His wit has run dry,” Phœbe explained. “He
opened the sluice too wide at first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” assented Jawn. “Her face is like the
Tombs of the Pharaohs because there’s more wisdom
within than the deepest archæologist can ever translate;
because the best part of her is hieroglyphic; because it’s
worth travelling ten thousand miles to see her; because
she is built fit for a king; because no man knows the
mystery of her creation, yet all wonder at the marvel
of it; because—do you want any more?”</p>

<p>“I just wished to bring you out, Jawn,” Phœbe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
apologized. “I didn’t want the reputation of the race
to languish. And thank you for the compliments. I’m
so glad you didn’t say—because it looks so derned
life-like and everybody knows it’s a dead one. But
that would be a mummy, wouldn’t it, and not the
Tomb of the Pharaohs?”</p>

<p>“If it had been a mummy,” said Jawn, “I might
have said, because in spite of years of married life she
is still so well preserved; or because——”</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” said Phœbe; “in a minute more
you’ll be sayin’ somethin’ you’ll be ashamed of. Don’t
forget, Jawn, that the Wells’ are very refined.”</p>

<p>“I was only going to say——” the light of deviltry
was in Jawn’s eyes, warning enough to this country
woman.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’!” she cried, and started from the room.
“The boys have docked, I see, and they’ll be wantin’
food. It’s a word of warnin’ I’m tellin’ you, Jawn de
Lancey Maguire—save all your piggy sayin’s for me
who understands them, and don’t go makin’ me ashamed
of you before the quality.”</p>

<p>She courtesied to Jerry and Mrs. Wells, threw a kiss
to Jawn, and slipped away.</p>

<p>“It’s a sprite she is,” said Jawn, “a red-headed Irish
fay.”</p>

<p>“She is a very great joy to us,” said Mrs. Wells
deliberately. “And who would think she was ten
years married and a widow! Phœbe hasn’t changed
a mite since she was twenty.”</p>

<p>“She’ll never be old,” said Jawn. “I can hardly
keep my eyes off her hair—it’s so brilliant and
fascinating.” He was about to say something equally
complimentary when he caught her shadow at the long
front windows. Mrs. Wells had seen her, too, peeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
behind a curtain, and showed the knowledge in her face.
“Fascinating?” he continued, “yes. And charming?
Not a doubt. She’ll be that way when she’s eighty—I’ve
known many of her kind—having all the young
boys dancing about her—unless she takes cold and dies
from poking her dainty head in at draughty windows!”</p>

<p>“Jawn de Lancey O’Rourke,” she poked her dainty
head further in, “you’ll force me to marry you yet in
self-defence.”</p>

<p>This time she was really gone. Down the road she
walked briskly, a fine glow on her face. It was such
an unusual joy for her to meet a mind as absurd as her
own. What good is a sense of the ridiculous, a kinship
with the Comic Spirit, if folks about you are for ever
taking you seriously? It simply means offence when
you had meant none; and scandal where none was
dreamed. The Wells were the right sort, because they
took nothing seriously from Phœbe, which was a good
thing in many ways: it gave Phœbe an outlet for some
real heavy matters that weighed on her soul, and she
never need fear too much sympathy. And it gave her
a chance to say the most literal truths about her neighbours,
to let loose her satire on their shortcomings, and
never to be suspected of wisdom.</p>

<p>The Wells, notwithstanding, were hardly more than
appreciative audience; Jawn, now, was a “pardner”—to
use the technical term of comedians. He stirred her
mind, provoked it, as none of the others did. And
every ripple of his own she felt akin to. It would be
glorious fun to fight quip with quip; even though he
were a rascal.</p>

<p>Of course he was a rascal. The pair of them were.
About Richard she might have had doubts, but about
Jawn—never! She knew an Irish villain when she saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
one. He was a rascal, but she was not sure that she
would be against him in the final reckoning. After all,
life was a game of matching wits; and if this Wells
Virginia-English strain was stupid should it not pay
the penalty? But that explanation of her partnership
was discarded before she got half-way down the hill.
The Irish rascal was a rascal for high philosophic
reasons: it was because he placed so little value upon
the world’s goods that he concerned himself even less
about the matter of precise ownership.—“I am taking
your watch,” he might say kindly, “about which you
should not grieve too much; for consider, when you
come to your last dozen breaths, how little value this
watch will have in your eyes, and how quickly you’d
give it for another year of living.”</p>

<p>That’s what made the Irish villain so captivating a
character in picturesque romances. He cracked his little
joke at the world; if he got off with it, he laughed;
if he got caught he laughed. The whole business of
having and losing is so trivial when life itself is trivial.</p>

<p>In some such ways she defended Jawn, but resolved
to watch him, nevertheless. If for no other reason
than to get the joy of the play of his mind, she would
watch him. And it was delightful to see how easily the
good Wells were taken in. Their idea of a swindler
was of a sneaking, Uriah Heepish, Sing-Singish cut-throat.
They had not the wit to conceive of an honest
blarneying lad who went straight at his task, open and
above-board.</p>

<p>And what, in the name of pity, had happened to the
mistress of the house? The most imposing creature in
Jerusalem township had actually shrunk into a timid,
smiling—it was as if the Red Queen (“Off with his
head!”) had suddenly become the White Queen (“Pat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
her on the head and see how pleased she’ll be”). We
all know how age creeps on us, but this time, thought
Phœbe, it had pounced! Mrs. Wells had lost her rigidly
erect bearing, her face had given up the fixed effort
of concentration, she was aimlessly drifting. “A little
kindness—and putting her hair in papers—would do
wonders with her!” Phœbe laughed at this picture
of the helpless White Queen, but the laugh soon died
away. The reality was not at all comic.</p>

<p>But no one would have guessed that back of Phœbe’s
public mirth and jollity was even a serious observation
of the change in Mother Wells. A fine sense of consideration
had kept even the glance of curiosity out of
her eyes. She was not the sort to greet a lady friend
with, “Goodness! Aren’t you getting a little stouter?”</p>

<p>She would not let even her own thoughts dwell too
long on her friend’s misfortune. The villains were
summoned again before her. Of course, Phœbe agreed
before she reached “Lombardy,” her cottage, that she
would keep an open mind about these mysterious gentlemen
with changeable names. They might in the end
turn out to be respectable. Very well. Her plan was
to stand guard and never be suspected. And the way
never to be suspected is to tell all your plans to the
enemy. They won’t believe you, which is exactly what
you want. “I’ll tell them they’re a set of rascals,” she
chuckled, “and that I’m watchin’ every move of them,
and they’ll laugh their heads off and never be disturbed
by my little joke.”</p>

<p>Richard and Walter were quite ready for Phœbe’s
impromptu luncheon, which she managed in the quickest
possible time and set for them on her porch. She
listened to their story of the lucky arrival of the
yacht, heard its name, <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i>, and listened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
to its virtues extolled, but kept aloof from their
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Walter was the first to notice her silence. “You
tol’ me to get it,” he said; “an’—I got it.”</p>

<p>“Well! well!” said Richard. “Are you at the
bottom of this, too?”</p>

<p>Richard had found his voice again.</p>

<p>“I always said if he owned his own boat he could do
wonders on this Lake.”</p>

<p>“You are very keen,” he smiled at her.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know my tables,” she replied cheerily; “and
I know a good sailor when I see one; and I know your
fellow-conspirator, Mr. De Lancey.”</p>

<p>Richard looked up from a sandwich, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re not going to go into the sulks
again?” she asked. “There’ll be no fun in houndin’
you to earth and layin’ bare your nefarious plots if every
time I get you in a corner you play deaf and dumb.”</p>

<p>He laughed good-naturedly. All the kinks were out
of his mind now; he felt vigorous and alert, and knew—he
was thankful—that Phœbe had ceased to depress
him into speechlessness. And following consistently his
tried theory, he knew that all was well between them.</p>

<p>“I was rude, wasn’t I?” he admitted. “That’s an
infirmity of mine, like an epileptic fit——”</p>

<p>“Oh, your friend De Lancey has fits, too. You are
a pair, all right.”</p>

<p>“I give up,” he said. “De Lancey is no friend of
mine. Please explain.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know a John De Lancey?”</p>

<p>“Never heard of him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s up at the Big House this minute. You
may not know him, but he knows you. To be sure
he got twisted in your name—said it was Mr. Dick—until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Jerry foolishly gave you away. Then he was sure
it was Mr. Richard. He said he had forgotten for the
moment what name you had agreed to travel on. You
two had better get together and rehearse. You’re both
bad actors. I’ll give you that much help, although I’m
warnin’ you,” she smiled broadly as she spoke, “that
I’m a lady detective in disguise. So look out!”</p>

<p>Walter looked on wisely as they talked. At first
he thought he would tell Phœbe what he knew about
assumed names; but decided later that she would find
it out soon enough. It was not his affair. He had
his boat, and he would go off and borrow old sails somewhere
and try her out. But before he went he exacted
from Phœbe the approval of his latest achievement.</p>

<p>“You said to get one,” he repeated, “an’ I got one.”</p>

<p>“Good boy!” she nodded to him cheerily. “I
knew you’d do it.”</p>

<p>That was enough to start him off to the tender in
great spirits.</p>

<p>Richard came back to the former topic.</p>

<p>“Really, Mrs. Norris——”</p>

<p>“Don’t Mrs. Norris me.”</p>

<p>“Really, Phœbe, I don’t know any De Lancey.
What sort of man is he?”</p>

<p>“Well, to begin with he is the happiest liar, outside
of your good self, that I’ve yet met. He’s Irish, and
he’s chuck full of limericks and connund——”</p>

<p>“Jove!” cried Richard. “It’s Jawn!”</p>

<p>“Jawn it is; Jawn De Lancey.”</p>

<p>“It’s Jawn Galloway,” he corrected. “It would
be just like him to imitate me and take another
name——”</p>

<p>“Then Mr. Richard is not your name?” she broke
in triumphantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“No,” he smiled wryly. “But you mustn’t tell Mrs.
Wells. Jerry knows. And so does Walter. You may
as well know too. In fact, I thought Jerry had told you.
But think of Jawn Galloway taking on a—did you say
De Lancey? Jack De Lancey! That is comic.”</p>

<p>“Very comic,” she mimicked. “You’re doin’ well.
But as I’m goin’ to get you both in the end you might
as well light yourself a cigarette and confess everything.
And I may let you off altogether if you flatter me a
little. I’m very susceptible to kind words. There’s
your cue, man. Now, go on with your tale.”</p>

<p>In a very straightforward manner he told her the
whole story from the accidental meeting with Jerry on
board the <i>Victoria</i> at Naples up to the complication
made by Walter’s outbreak.</p>

<p>As the story developed, Phœbe gradually lost her
chipper attitude. There was something terribly convincing
about the Walter episode. She knew all about
that threat to do away with himself; it had been made
to her, too, and it had taken all her diplomacy to put
a right attitude in the boy and start him off on his
trip with the mother freed from much of his unnatural
antipathy. But secretly she had always believed that
Walter’s threats were idle boasts. The reality frightened
her, for Richard made no attempt either to minimize
or magnify the determined struggle of the boy to
end his mixed-up life on the stern of the steamer.</p>

<p>“Well,” she drew in a deep breath, “you may be
featherin’ your nest or not; all I say is you’ve earned
the right to do what you please up at the Big House.
As far as you are concerned, Mr. What-ever-your-name-is,
I resign; but I’ll keep my eye on your Jawn friend
a little longer, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Richard smoked away for a while in great contentment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“Do you know, Phœbe,” he turned to her chummily,
“I really may be feathering my nest, as you call it;
and without ever intending to perform that delicate
operation.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re old enough to know your way about.”
She busied herself clearing away the lunch dishes.</p>

<p>“Age doesn’t help at that,” he said, “it hinders. The
older you grow the more sure you seem; but you fool
yourself.... I’m sure I don’t know why I do anything.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t come all the way to Penn Yan on a
wild-goose chase. Don’t tell me that.”</p>

<p>“That’s life exactly,” he said, “a wild-goose chase.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” she sniffed significantly. “You can’t
fool your grandmother! Every sensible person in this
world is after something, and he knows mighty well
what it is. It’s all moonshine, this not knowin’ why you
do things. Now, own up; it wasn’t an overpowering
interest in Walter that brought you here; now, was it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it was,” he admitted cheerfully.</p>

<p>“And it wasn’t due to the overpowering attractions
of Phœbe Norris?” she persisted in her cross-examination.</p>

<p>“It may have been,” he looked at her calmly.</p>

<p>“What?” she cried. “You’d never heard of me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he argued, “Adam had never heard of
Eve, but God went on confidently making all the
arrangements.”</p>

<p>She mused over the thought.</p>

<p>“I forgot,” she said finally. “I did invite you to
lay on a little flattery. And you did it well. And,
by the same token, though I know it’s a lie, it gives
one a mighty pleasin’ sensation.... Go along with
you, man!... Adam and Eve!... Pfut!... It’s a
scandalous picture you’re after puttin’ into my mind!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>TREMOR CORDIS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> showed no indication to leave his comfortable
place on Phœbe Norris’ porch. And Phœbe
hummed about her work like a young healthy bee.
When she felt particularly pleased she put little burbles
of low laughter between her sentences; chuckles is not
the exact word; they were suggestive rather of the
cooing of pigeons. On the Lake the conversation could
not be distinguished, but these interjectory ripples
floated out clearly enough.</p>

<p>It was the first thing Walter heard when he had
staggered down to the dock with an old mainsail and
a tattered jib which he had resurrected from the top
of a neighbouring oat stack. The music heartened
him, though he was physically pretty well spent. It
was all right, he said to himself; all right.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you had better be going to the
rescue of your friend Jawn De Lancey Galloway
O’Toole?” Phœbe remarked as she stood before
Richard and polished a plate. “He’ll be needin’ you,
I’m thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“Jawn can take care of himself,” Richard had
rejoined.</p>

<p>“Ordinarily, yes,” she agreed, “if he weren’t gallivantin’.
But when an Irishman like Jawn begins to
gallivant, his tongue waggles at both ends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“What’s gallivanting?” inquired Richard lazily.
“Comes from ‘galli’ to gallop—doesn’t it?—and
‘vanti,’ vanity; ‘The vanity of horsemanship.’ The
only thing Jawn can ride successfully is a subway
express.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong entirely on your etymology, young
man,” she nodded sagely. “The word ‘gallivant’
comes from the ‘gal,’ meaning ‘woman,’ and ‘vanting,’
meanin’ ‘wantin’ ’em bad.’ At the rate he was goin’
when I left him,” she chuckled—or burbled, or whatever
name you choose for a yet unnamed accomplishment,
“he’s probably on the way to the priest-house
by this time.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the woman?” Richard inquired.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>he</i> didn’t begin by pretendin’ it was the old
lady!”</p>

<p>Richard considered that statement for several seconds,
while Phœbe hummed about him.</p>

<p>“Let him!” he finally said.</p>

<p>“One of the first symptoms of insanity,” Phœbe suggested
judicially, although she knew exactly the train
of unexpressed thought that led to the “Let him!”
“one of the very first signs—and I should know what
I am talking about—is sudden and unexpected jumps
in the conversation. When I would remark to Seth
that it was time to feed the chickens and he would
reply, ‘I wish I had a white rat,’ I always knew it was
time to hide the hammer and lock up the axe....
You’re not feelin’ a bit ferocious, are you?”</p>

<p>It was the joking over Richard’s possible madness
that led to the particular set of intimate “burbles”
which caught Walter’s attention suddenly, and made
him stop in the midst of “bending on” the mainsail, and
listen. He caught not a single word, but the <i>timbre</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
if one may so describe it, of the conference was unmistakably
friendly and affectionate. Just so she had
laughed and joked with him to cheer him out of moodiness,
and the lilt in her voice had been the only decent
memory in his life. Somehow, he could not believe that
she would ever offer it to anyone else—madmen and
lovers have such notions—it was his private possession,
he thought; but now she was hovering over another
man and——</p>

<p>Something Richard said—a bit of nonsense, no
doubt—had brought a little shriek of delight from
Phœbe, but the remainder of his speech she would not
have. Quickly she had darted back of him and had
placed a hand firmly over his mouth, cutting off a sentence
in mid-air. But her low vibrating laughter
showed that she had appreciated the humour of whatever
had been said.</p>

<p>That act, trifling in itself and thoroughly characteristic
of Phœbe Norris, inflamed Walter; it sent a shock
through him that started the blood coursing and left
him shaking violently with nervousness. He opened his
mouth the better to breathe; spasms of trembling swept
over him; he sat crouched up amid a swirl of sail-cloth
and stared at the two happy persons before him.</p>

<p>An impartial judge would have decided that the relations
between Mr. Richard and Mrs. Norris had not
altered one thousandth of a millimetre from luncheon.
Before Walter or behind Walter there had not been the
slightest shadow of change in the outward attitude.
The low laughter had been pulsating before; the jests
had been passed and repassed; and even the friendly
fillip had been exposed to view. But to Walter, seared
with the burning iron of sudden jealousy, all these personal
touches were born of the moment, staged now for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
the first time, as the bill-boards say. The data for that
sort of thing has been worked over pretty thoroughly;
see the case of Othello versus Desdemona, or Leontes,
king of Sicilia, versus Hermione, his queen. Over an
innocent public leave-taking, one remembers,—the
guest, Polixenes, is making his farewells to the hostess—Leontes
cries, “I have tremor cordis on me! My
heart dances, but not for joy! not joy!”</p>

<p>“Tremor cordis” it was, but Walter could make no
pretty speeches about it. No word could have come
from him. It was pitiful to see him struggling to get
breath; pitiful unless one saw also the gleam of hate in
his eye.</p>

<p>What should he do to rid himself of the suffering
that possessed him? His first impulse was to burst in
upon them and fight it out openly with whatever
weapon appeared; but that impulse never got so far as
a single movement: the big man, he knew, could fling
him into the Lake, and the woman could pierce him
with a glance and a score of scornful words. Craft
whispered in his ear to bide his time and, above all,
make sure. Jealousy demands evidence, concrete proof,
specific torture to add to the mental anguish. Perhaps—Phœbe
had gone off in a matter-of-fact way to see to
her chickens, and Richard was coming down to the
dock—perhaps there was nothing to it after all.</p>

<p>Almost as abruptly as it came the feeling of being
dispossessed left him; all but the memory of it and a
vague presentiment that he must be ever watchful. The
exultant mood that followed took him to the other
extreme. He laughed and seized the sail vigorously;
and when Richard reached the dock he was humming a
sort of a tune.</p>

<p>“Good boy!” Richard encouraged, when he saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
amount of work already done. “Here Phœbe and I
have been fooling away the time while you have been
working like a shoemaker. Why, we’ll be able to try
her out to-day; won’t we?”</p>

<p>In spite of his feeling that all was well again Walter
found it hard to control his speech.</p>

<p>“N-not t-to-day,” he managed. “No w-wind.”</p>

<p>What he meant to say was that he was too dog-tired
to hoist sail and take the trial. It took all his strength
to make the boat shipshape for the night.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t there?” Richard squinted about the
heavens. “Well then, if it’s all the same to you, old
chap, I’ll just trot up to the house and see my friend
Jawn. Jawn’s a wild one when he’s on his vacation,
and the Lord only knows what I’ll have to apologize
for. So long!”</p>

<p>Walter watched him greedily to see if he really took
the road that led to the Big House; and then, when his
eyes had assured him, his suspicious brain suggested
plots and stratagems. He stood up in the boat and
craned his head to listen for sounds of Phœbe talking to
her chickens. From the “chicken-runs” came not a
single “cluck.” Some of the former “tremor cordis”
seized him again, but not so violently; he shot a leg into
the tender, tilting it at a frightful angle, and luckily
managed to pilot the skiff to shore successfully. There
was ten feet of water at the end of the dock.</p>

<p>Phœbe was not among the chickens; nor could he see
her in the orchard, nor in the vineyards tilted up in full
view on the hill. They had gone off together! It was
a ruse to fool him! Oaths slipped from him, as he
dashed up the hill and then down through the orchard
to Phœbe’s house. He almost ran into her as she
emerged suddenly from among the dahlias. She had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
large bunch of deep purple flowers in her arm, which
she almost dropped at his sudden excited appearance.</p>

<p>“Land o’ Goshen!” she ejaculated. “If you start
runnin’ wild about here, I’ll be forgettin’ myself and
takin’ ye for Seth and lock you up for the night in the
‘pen’!... What’s the matter with you, boy? You’re
all of a shake.”</p>

<p>A little tenderness softened her tone. She tried to
take hold of his trembling hand, but he grinned and
brought himself together.</p>

<p>“Jus’ l-lookin’ for y-you,” he stammered foolishly.</p>

<p>“You’re a funny boy,” she laughed, with some of her
native crooning in her voice. “A funny boy!...
Come in and sit down and tell me all about the new
boat. I’m all excited about the races. I see myself
standin’ on the dock at Alley’s Inn with a pair of field-glasses
screwed to me two eyes and rainin’ curses on my
good friends Tyler and Fagner.”</p>

<p>“Goin’ to beat ’em both;” Walter glowed under her
loyal chatter.</p>

<p>“An’ don’t forget, boy,” she told him gravely, “that
if you don’t win I’ll be feelin’ all the more sympathy
for you. It’ll be much better for you if you lose; for
then I’ll spend <i>all</i> my time thinkin’ of you.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t win,” he began savagely, “I’ll—I’ll——”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothin’ of the kind,” she calmed him
firmly. “You’ll just try again, like everybody else.
There isn’t a skipper on the Lake but what has lost a
race some time or other.”</p>

<p>After a long chat together—Walter could always
talk to Phœbe Norris—Phœbe told him it was time to
go home. He did not want to go. The lunch was fine,
but there were too many at lunch. Why not have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
little cosy supper together—just the two of them—on
the porch, watching the sunset?</p>

<p>“You’re goin’ home, boy;” she was jocular but
determined. “The breath of scandal has never yet
tarnished me fair escutcheon. I don’t know what an
escutcheon is, my boy, or whether it’s right and proper
for a female to have one; but I know I’m not goin’ to
be entertainin’ handsome young bachelors—meanin’ you—all
alone by meself at seducin’ suppers. Go ’long
with you.”</p>

<p>And although she drove him off and he was very
much disappointed, yet he walked up the hill delighted
with himself. Phœbe always had that effect on him,
and she was quite aware of it. She watched him like a
mother as he stalked on, and waved a hand when he
turned half-way up the hill and looked back.</p>

<p>“Well, he seems chipper enough now,” she puzzled
over him, “but he was rather wild at first.... I wonder
what got into the lad.”</p>

<p>Richard had not gone directly up to “Red Jacket.”
The vineyards took his eye. The rows and rows of
dwarfed grape plants and their thick clusters of perfect
grapes—now hard and green, of course—reminded
him of similar vineyards in France and along the banks
of the Rhine. A negro workman here and there was
quite willing to stop and talk. There were two interests
here for Richard—one was the methods used
for keeping these vines free from the thousand and one
enemies of the fruit, and the other was the curious bit
of history represented by these descendants of a Virginia
slave plantation transferred to the North and still
working for the old family.</p>

<p>So it was growing upon dusk before he left the vineyard
and strolled up to the Big House. “Tshoti,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
“Non,” “Da” and “Waga”—the four huge porch
columns—loomed tremendously in the half light. He
caught a portion of their mystery and remembered
Jerry’s prediction that one night he should come upon
them unexpectedly as they performed their sentinel
guard, and that he would feel himself grow small in
their presence.</p>

<p>Jawn was entertaining the Wells family when
Richard arrived.</p>

<p>“Make a limerick on Phœbe Norris?” he was repeating
a question, possibly to gain time. “Sure I
can!” He rolled his eyes upward. “Sure I can!
It’s a simple matter, if you know how. Uh—let me
see. ‘There was a young lady named Phœbe.’ No!
That would never do. The only rhyme for Phœbe is
‘Hebe,’ the goddess of beer. U-m!... I have it!
Well, how’s this?”</p>

<p>Richard spoiled that limerick by asking:</p>

<p>“Won’t someone introduce me to the poet?” and his
hand went out eagerly to meet Jawn’s.</p>

<p>Jawn, however, was not so receptive. With a jocularity
that was understood by everyone but the watchful
Walter, he protested that he couldn’t be certain
whether he ought to meet the gentleman for the first
time or kiss him on either cheek as an old boyhood
friend; he couldn’t be certain until they got together
secretly and connived a bit. A bit of conniving now
and then, he assured everybody, was relished by the best
of men—and the worst of women. He had come to
“Red Jacket,” he complained, with a perfectly good
alias, and hardly had he been enjoying a high-class
name for an hour when the daughter of the house saw
through his verbal disguise and exposed him to the
ridicule of the natives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“Under the aristocratic name of Jawn Dalrymple—or
was it Dalton?” he looked about him imploringly.</p>

<p>“It was De Lancey,” helped Jerry.</p>

<p>“De Lancey, of course!——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells interrupted. “I beg pardon,” she said,
“I don’t want to seem stupid, but I thought you said
your name was De Lancey? Isn’t that your name, Mr.
De Lancey?”</p>

<p>Jerry explained carefully. “He was just joking us,
mother. He is Mr. Richard’s old friend Mr. Galloway,
Professor John Galloway of Columbia University.”</p>

<p>“The cat’s out!” Jawn turned disconsolately to
Richard; “so I might as well shake hands and own up.
It was a great mistake. I see it now. I ought to
have worn whiskers.”</p>

<p>“But, really,” Mrs. Wells seemed very much
concerned, “I can’t see why he should not have said
Galloway from the beginning.”</p>

<p>The attempt to make clear Jawn’s reason for an incognito
was not very successful, due to the fact that
Richard’s incognito could not be explained. Even
Jawn saw that. Both Richard and Jerry gave him
open signals that it would not be politic to try to clear
up two incognitos in one evening—all of which was not
lost on Walter—and Mrs. Wells’ disturbed face was
ample evidence that silence on that score was the best
policy.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how it is,” Jawn jumped into the breach.
“My real name is De Lancey, but when a lad I was
adopted by a wealthy New York banker named Galloway.
Well, he lost all his money and died leaving me
nothing but the name. Naturally I sometimes forget
and use the old one out of habit.”</p>

<p>The romantic explanation pleased Mrs. Wells immensely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
She grew tremendously interested in the rich
banker and wanted to know many particulars. Jawn
was never at a loss for details.</p>

<p>Walter was keenly interested in Jawn’s talk but, he
told himself, he was not at all taken in by it. A numbing
remembrance of the afternoon’s suspicions came
into the background of his mind and settled there. It
was a spectre at all his banquets of happiness: it darted
its chill into his best re-visioning of even that latest
chat with Phœbe when she called him a handsome young
bachelor and hinted scandalous things. So it behoved
him to prepare his defences against attack.</p>

<p>The situation was very clear to Walter. This “Mr.
Richard” was some sort of a confidence man. He first
attracted the ladies and then subtracted their purses,
or borrowed huge sums from them on bad notes, or got
them to invest in worthless stocks. He had heard about
these fellows. The books were full of them—not only
the paper-backs, either, but real books—meaning
cloth-covers—like <i>Wallingford</i> and <i>Blacky Daw</i> and
<i>Raffles</i>. Jawn, of course, was a detective on the trail
of Richard. In spite of all his joking and laughing,
anyone could see that he kept his eye on Richard. Did
Richard know that he was being trailed? Walter
suspected that he did not.</p>

<p>He wondered if it were criminal to use another man’s
name, a big man’s name at that, one whose reputation
was world-wide, whose millions of money earned as railroad
and steamship owner, international banker and
dealer in monopolies in general, had made his name
known even to children. That was the name on the card
tacked carelessly on “Mr. Richard’s” door. He must
be engaged in crime on a big scale to need to assume
that name. And why had he changed it? And what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
was his real name? These were questions which Walter
would like answered. Perhaps a little careful probing
of Jerry would tell him something.</p>

<p>Later in the evening she was conscious of his following
her about. In the tail of her eye she could see him
sidling along the hall as she turned into a room, or
standing afar off and watching strangely while she
talked to someone. One got used to having a “queer”
brother in the house, but these movements, stealthy
and clumsy at once, were not usual.</p>

<p>“Want to see yuh,” he said to her finally.</p>

<p>“All right, Walter,” she agreed; “go out on the
porch and sit beside ‘Waga.’”</p>

<p>“Jes’ y-you,” he nodded; “n-nobody else.”</p>

<p>“All right, Walter.”</p>

<p>Between “Waga” and “Da” they sat and looked
out upon the wide sheet of blue water, startlingly clear
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“H-he’s gotta keep away from Phœbe,” Walter
managed to begin.</p>

<p>Jerry was too used to managing her brother to show
astonishment at any remark. He was easily frightened off.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p>“H-he’s been hangin’ ’round, laughin’ and—lookin’
at her.”</p>

<p>“But everyone does, Walter,” she said; “who can
help it? She is wonderful, you know.”</p>

<p>“She’s all right,” said he.</p>

<p>Walter seemed to have nothing further to add to
that topic, and Jerry knew better than to try to force
him to talk. She waited until he began again.</p>

<p>“Smart boy, he is.” His speech became clearer as
he grew in confidence, and his manner became more
aggressive. “Talks a lot.... But he’s a crook.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>The “he,” Jerry figured, must mean Jawn.</p>

<p>“Funny names, and all that,” he explained.</p>

<p>After a moment he laughed derisively, almost vindictively.
“Says his name’s Richard! Huh! Richard
Richard! Hah! Fools the women all right. But don’t
fool me.... Has ’nother name, too.” He fumbled
in his pocket and produced the card that Richard had
ripped off his stateroom door. “But I cornered him.
Tol’ me ’at was a fake name, too. Found it on his
things ... in his stateroom.... Big gun, he was
tryin’ to be.... Big gun.”</p>

<p>Mechanically Jerry took the card. By the light from
the window she could see the hold black characters.
It was indeed a big gun, one of the Crœsuses of his
age. It seemed less like the name of a person, as
she studied it, than that of some heavily advertised
merchandise.</p>

<p>Jerry was not a newspaper reader, but vaguely she
was conscious of knowing something about that name.
While Walter bragged of his cleverness in discovering
this further act of imposture, she was searching over
her memory. Suddenly it became clear that the man
whose card she held in her hand had been dead several
years; he had gone down at sea with his whole family;
she was not sure, but she thought she remembered
something about an accident to a sea-going yacht off
the Newfoundland Banks.</p>

<p>“Where did you find this card?” she asked.</p>

<p>“On his door.”</p>

<p>“His stateroom door?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s the name he was goin’ to use at first,
but I scared him off. Tore it down, he did, when I
came ’long.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps somebody else put it there by mistake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“Nope! He owned up all right, when I put it to
him.”</p>

<p>“Just how did he ‘own up,’ as you say?”</p>

<p>“Said——” Walter thought for a moment to get the
words right, “—said he was sorry to use a fine name
like that; said if I’d keep mum he’d stick by me.”</p>

<p>“And so you are keeping mum.”</p>

<p>“Well!” he flared. “Guess I c’n tell it to my own
sister, can’t I?...  An’ he ain’t stickin’ by me.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she recalled. “You think he is interested in
Phœbe?”</p>

<p>“Well, he better not be.”</p>

<p>No matter what Jerry may have privately thought
she knew her duty at this moment, and that was to rid
this boy’s mind of the suspicions that had begun to
darken it. She was startled by the revelation; she
would have to get alone and think things together
before she could make up her mind as to the meaning
of the facts Walter had presented; particularly was she
astonished at Walter’s interest in protecting Phœbe
Norris; but all that she cast aside and bent to the task
of reassuring Walter of Richard’s good faith. She
reminded him of the scene at the back of the <i>Victoria</i>,
and drew tactfully the picture of Richard’s work in
saving Walter from a terrible “accident”; she repeated
Richard’s constant expression of interest in Walter’s
welfare; but none of these seemed to affect the boy in
the least.</p>

<p>Then she was driven out of the truth. “A fib in time
saves nine,” she remembered one of Richard’s jokes.
Prevarications had been piling up ever since that first
deception. “Oh, what a tangled web we weave when
first we practise to deceive!” One must keep in mind
that in spite of Jerry’s calm in Walter’s presence she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
had always been afraid of him. He was absolutely
heartless and, when he had the courage, brutal. In her
own heart she believed he was a harmless lunatic who
might any moment become violent. So she steadied
herself for a final effort.</p>

<p>“You are quite wrong about Richard and Phœbe.
They are simply good friends,” she said.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” he cried. “I’ve seen ’em
together and he talks soft to her an’——” He began
to work himself into a dangerous mood.</p>

<p>“I know what I’m talking about, Walter,” she
increased the firmness of her tone. “Richard is not
interested in Phœbe at all, in the way you mean.”</p>

<p>“Got to show me,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“I can prove it.”</p>

<p>“Aw! He’d lie quick enough.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I would lie to you, Walter?”</p>

<p>No; Walter did not think so. Jerry always spoke
the truth. Jerry was all right.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” she said, nerving herself for the
statement, “Richard is not interested in Phœbe Norris;
he—he is interested in me.”</p>

<p>The effect upon Walter was all that she had expected.
He softened up suddenly, grew exultant at the turn
which his clogged mind had not guessed, but which, all
at once, seemed perfectly apparent.</p>

<p>“Is that so!” he cried. “Did he ask you to marry
him?”</p>

<p>“Richard and I understand each other,” she replied
evasively.</p>

<p>“Good girl!” he said, thinking only of his own luck.</p>

<p>After ruminating over the new situation for a while
he rose to go. His laugh was almost pleasant.</p>

<p>“Clever boy, that Richard,” he said; “clever boy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
he is! Always said he was a clever boy. Smart, he is!
Smart! I tol’ him——” He chuckled at the thought.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I tol’ him once ’at you had the tin——”</p>

<p>“Tin? Oh, yes; I understand. Go on.”</p>

<p>“I tol’ him you’d have a good share; and he seemed
mighty pleased. Oh, he’s smart, he is!”</p>

<p>“How is your boat, Walter?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Aw right.... Tol’ me, he did, ’at he didn’t
believe in work. Pfut!” he spluttered out an ironic
laugh; “no use workin’ when you c’n jus’ pick it up
easy. Oh, he’s a very smart, clever boy!”</p>

<p>It took all Jerry’s will to control her instinctive
desire to slap the boy’s smirking face.</p>

<p>“Well,” she smiled; “it’s rather late for a skipper,
isn’t it? Early to bed nowadays if you want to have
a chance in these races.”</p>

<p>“Tha’s right,” he agreed and yawned prodigiously.
“Guess I’ll be goin’ to bed.” But the single idea was
not easily dislodged from his mind. “Clever boy, he
is! Clever and—smart!”</p>

<p>“Good-night, Walter.” Jerry spoke very sweetly,
a great tribute to her growing power of control over
speech.</p>

<p>As Walter sauntered in the great central door she
heard the voices of Jawn and Richard. Evidently they
were coming out upon the porch.</p>

<p>“Where’s Jerry?” she heard Richard ask.</p>

<p>While Walter was mumbling his reply—his tones
were cheerful, she was glad to note—she slipped into
the grounds at the side and made quickly off to the
winding road at the back which leads up to the top of
the ridge. Until she could collect her thoughts she did
not want to see either man. In her perturbed condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
Richard’s mildness would have stirred her to
quarrel, and Jawn’s hearty volubility would have led
to a blow. She was quite sure that if he had attempted
another limerick she would have screamed.</p>

<p>The walk up the old familiar road was a soothing
delight. She went on till she came to the hunter’s hut
wherein she had spent many a fine winter night. An
old kitchen chair was waiting invitingly on its slender
porch. There she sat and tried to get her mental
bearings while the serene moon grew higher and higher
in the sky.</p>

<p>Alone on the porch of the hunter’s lodge with the
dark valley before her and a patch of the white-blue
Lake shining brilliantly in the moonlight, Jerry called
herself to account. The quickly planned “fib” which
she had just told to Walter was worrying her. To be
sure, Richard of all persons would understand exactly
the motive that led her to her supposed confession and
he would see the necessity of it. That did not bother
her half so much as the effect which the spoken words
had had upon herself. The moment they were uttered
she experienced a most uncomfortable feeling of joy and
guilt. It was as if she had unwittingly expressed her
very self.</p>

<p>Richard, no doubt, would explain it glibly with his
theory of “subliminal self,” which is always telling us
the unknown truth. Why had that expedient come so
pat to her tongue? She did not need to ask. Whether
or not the questionable “subliminal” had spoken, she,
the only self she really believed in, knew it to be the
expression of her own wish.</p>

<p>Had she known this disturbing fact from the beginning?
Lovers are prone to claim as much. Isn’t it
the time-honoured formula to ask. “When did you—ah—begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
to care?” and to answer, “From the beginning.”
As she reviewed their days together from that
long uncomfortable first day on the steamer when unknown
to him she had lounged beside him in her
steamer-chair and watched him repel each invader of
his solitude, the design of her life began to appear;
and she knew, then, that she had “cared from the
beginning.”</p>

<p>Predestination, Richard would call it. She smiled
at the picture of his mild interested face as he would
analyze the rare experience into terms of kismet.
“The gods” would be blamed cheerfully.</p>

<p>Each incident was fitted into its mate to make the
full design. She had watched the modern Gobelin
weavers in Paris and noted how the meaningless
splotches of colour here and there grew gradually into
a meaningful pattern. Life was like that. Her suggestion
that they go about Naples together; the
intimacy caused by the incognito; her own insistence
upon secrecy; the invitation to “Red Jacket”; even
her indignation at his suggestion that she would
eventually make eyes at him—all these were parts of
the curious weaving.</p>

<p>And she had begun already to make eyes at him!
Not in a literal sense, to be sure—she would die before
she did that—but in confessing her hopes to Walter
she had gone a considerable step toward making the
first move.</p>

<p>Hers was the type of mind which cleared up one
confused thought at a time. The important matter of
her own relation to Richard having been settled, she
permitted Walter’s accusations to come in review.
Was this impersonal friendly Richard a genteel bad
man, after all? She could not decide. The actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
card which Walter had found on his door looked like
the practice of some sort of confidence man. She
remembered that he had been most reluctant to give
up the comfortable “Mr. Richard” which she had
dubbed him. And his philosophy of drifting along,
coupled with no occupation and a shocking state of
low funds—all that seemed to fit in; along with his
even more shocking lack of a sense of the culpability
of all wrong-doers.</p>

<p>And she had been quite taken by his philosophy.
A faithful Episcopalian—true to her Virginia traditions—she
had never questioned religious matters.
She had neither believed deeply nor troubled herself
to disbelieve. Richard it was who constantly reminded
her of the foundation principles of her own faith.
“Neither do I condemn thee” had been one of his
most striking quotations. “Judge not lest ye also be
judged” was another; and “Father, forgive them;
they know not what they do.” And now she saw
that this attitude would be consistent with the credo
of a man who might choose to act against the moral
code of those about him. According to Walter,
Richard was after her “tin.” “Well,” she laughed,
“he is welcome to it—what there is of it—so long as
he is willing to take me, too.”</p>

<p>But Walter had also hinted rather strongly—strange
how this important thought had come last in review!—that
Richard had been paying open court to Phœbe
Norris. So far her mind had worked openly and
frankly in the light. Now it began to deceive her;
or rather, to put it in terms that Richard might have
employed, the subliminal self did not lay all its cards
on the table. It was a most uncomfortable thought
that Richard and Phœbe Norris should be chatting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
and laughing together intimately—a most uncomfortable
thought. But Jerry did not at all recognize the
little wave of “tremor cordis” that made her “heart
dance.” She saw instead the evil that might come to
Richard and to Phœbe if an innocent and proper
relationship should be allowed to grow until Walter
might be aroused to some vile deed. They must all
be saved from that! She would warn them both. Oh,
it was very necessary that they should be warned.</p>

<p>And with that decision a tranquil feeling possessed
her, which assured her that she had decided exactly
right; so tranquil and inspiriting that she rose and
walked along the ridge for a mile or more until she
came to the spot where she could see the main body
of Lake Keuka spread out wondrously before her.
Then she walked briskly home and went light-heartedly
to bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>LOVE LIMERICKS OF A LEFT-TENANT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning the men were off early to inspect
the new yacht and to assist Walter in “bending
on” the last make-shift sail. Jawn, however, went
reluctantly.</p>

<p>“It’s a beautiful view from here,” he objected
lazily; “why go down into it and mess it up with us?
We don’t help the landscape much. We’re not a set
of Corot dancing wood-nymphs.”</p>

<p>Richard tried to tell him that it was imperative to
study Walter at first hand.</p>

<p>“Nymphs, now,” Jawn went on, boldly disregarding
all Richard’s patter. “Nymphs, now, is a good suggestive
word. It stimulates the rhyming sense. You
see there a hard word and you say to yourself, Can it
be done? And you reply, If it is the business of a
man to do ’t I’ll do ’t. U-m!...”</p>

<p>He waved a large forefinger, beating time to a story
of “two pale gentleman nymphs” made ineffably
fragile through the fact that their “forbears were
lacking in lymphs.”</p>

<p>Walter had gone on ahead. Richard and Jawn were
following slowly.</p>

<p>“I had rather stay and add more kindling to my
fire of devotion.” Jawn turned in the road and flung
a stage kiss at the Ionic columns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“It is a fine old house,” grinned Richard; “I don’t
wonder at your devotion to it.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Jawn grunted as he trudged down the
hill. “Do you think I am attached to the architecture
like a bit of indecent ivy? It’s not a parasite,
I am. I’m a—what’s an amorite, friend Richard?
Hasn’t it something to do with the divine passion?”</p>

<p>“Amorite?” Richard studied. “That’s the sexton,
isn’t it? The chap who marches ahead of the rector
carrying a banner or something. You wouldn’t do
for that at all, Jawn.”</p>

<p>“Ach! You’re thinking of acolyte, you fool. You
can’t pass me on ecclesiastical forms; I was once a
sweet cherub of an altar boy and know all about such
matters. No,” he sighed; “it’s no leanings toward
priesthood I have; but something entirely worldly and
fleshly and devilly.”</p>

<p>“How many does this make, Jawn?”</p>

<p>“How many?” he retorted. “I suppose you mean
to imply that my devotion lacks in constancy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are constant enough!” Richard laughed.
“You’re always completely gone on some girl—always.”</p>

<p>“It’s a terrible infirmity.”</p>

<p>“Did you bring your book with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” snapped Jawn.</p>

<p>“Well, what number is this one?”</p>

<p>“Seventy-seven. But you needn’t grin so sarcastic
like; I’m feeling that this is the final number.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“I’m no astrologer,” Jawn explained, “but I have
eyes in my head. Now, anyone can see how mystical
and sonorous is the number seventy-seven. If you
multiply the first digit by the second digit you get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
forty-nine; and if you divide immediately by the
second digit you get the golden number seven. If you
add the first digit to the second digit you get fourteen,
which divided by the number of digits, two you get
back your golden number seven. And there you have
four golden number sevens dancing before you like
a bunch of four-leaf clover.”</p>

<p>“And if you subtract the first digit from the second
digit,” Richard suggested, “you get nothing.”</p>

<p>“Precisely!” cried Jawn. “And in the occult
language of figurology any novice would read, ‘Here
endeth the list of heart-broken maidens; behold! there
will be no more!’”</p>

<p>“Jawn,” said Richard, “I think I know the reason
why you always fail.”</p>

<p>“Fail!” Jawn exploded. “I never fail. The sad
part of the business is that I always succeed. Scattered
over the eastern and middle-western United States are
seventy-six forlorn women of all years who are now
hopelessly married to men they must hate. For why?
When Lazarus came back from the gates of Paradise
do you suppose he ever again took delight in the
left-overs from Dives’ table? No more they. But
what could I do? Unbidden the amorous passion
came and swift and unbidden it went. So what could
I do but write their names in a book, add the date
of their amorous demise——”</p>

<p>“Which always corresponded to the date of their
wedding!”</p>

<p>“Exactly. You wouldn’t have me getting mixed
up with the unwritten laws of the land, would you?
I simply write their names and add a touching obituary
limerick.”</p>

<p>Richard suggested that the seventy-seventh limerick—since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
Jawn was so assured that it would be the last—should
end the series, and that the collection be
published.</p>

<p>“It would add to your fame as a poet,” Richard
argued, “immortalize the ladies in everlasting verse and
bring you a financial heart-balm.”</p>

<p>Jawn mused over the possible titles. “‘The Seventy-seven
Amours,’” he tried out one. “Sounds too much
like a history of Chicago.... ‘Love Limericks.’ No.
There’s a female touch to that that I don’t like....
Ah! I have it! ‘Love Limericks of a Left-tenant.’
It’s thoroughly male and gives the proper Irish picture
of a forcible eviction!”</p>

<p>“Have you written Jerry’s yet?” Richard asked.</p>

<p>“What, man!” Jawn affected great disgust.
“Would you write an obituary verse while the corpse
is still sitting up and drinking beer with you? Have
you no artistic sense? Of course not! Well, then,
have you even common decency?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Richard probed him. “I thought as this
one was going to be the climax you would take a
running start, as it were.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” Jawn was derisive. “I know your sort.
You’re the kind who sample all the bottles before the
wake begins, and start premature explosions which
spoil the solemnity and gaiety of the rest of the
mourners. Besides, there ain’t going to be no corpse
this time. Ergo, there won’t be no limerick. It’ll be
an ode I’ll write, a bursting prothalamium, a lyrical
celebration of the joys of requited affection.”</p>

<p>They were now coming in sight of Walter at work.</p>

<p>“No, it won’t,” said Richard. “It will be a limerick
like all the others. You are doomed to failure, Jawn;
and the reason is that you ply your amours too well.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
You are a professional. You are too perfect. There’s
not a flaw in your attack, and therefore you fail to
attract. It’s the perfect manufactured article versus
the crude hand-made bit of craftsmanship. No; Jawn,
I fear you’ll die a Left-tenant.”</p>

<p>“I fear so,” admitted Jawn cheerfully. “I fear so;
and I hope so! Lord love you! My memory is so
full of delicious experiences that I’d feel like Bluebeard
if I ever settled down to simple domestic servitude.
And I wouldn’t like it, I know. Ach! I’d rather be
a left-tenant every day in the week than a major-domo
for ever.”</p>

<p>While they waited on the dock for Walter to row
in with the tender, Richard asked Jawn what he
thought of the boy.</p>

<p>“What do I think of him?” Jawn echoed. “Well,
to speak in technical language which all the world
understands, I think he’s a damned young fool.”</p>

<p>Richard pressed him to look at the case seriously.</p>

<p>“This is no case for me,” said Jawn decisively.
“He’s got a screw loose. It’s hardware he needs,”
Jawn tapped his head, “and I’m not in the business.
Besides, I’m on my vacation. You doctor him. I’m
too busy. I’m specializing on the sister.”</p>

<p>Jawn was obstinately determined to enjoy his vacation.
He was willing to psychologize all winter, he
said, and in the Summer School when compelled by the
Dean, but vacation means “to vacate,” he protested;
and that means to let your mind loaf, and be silly, and
wallow in its uncultivated, native soil.</p>

<p>Jawn was a very modern type of American “professor”
and corresponded not at all to the conventional
conception. He was not beetle-eyed, nor ponderous,
nor absent-minded, a picture we have borrowed from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
Europe where dignity is demanded of the professor, and
all the pompous qualities of solemnity. The European
sort exists in America, too—he was the original settler!—but
side by side is a distinctive American variety.
The American type came in in the late ’80’s and early
’90’s when college teachers were ceasing to be so stiffly
clerical in physical and mental cut; he arrived just at
the time, too, when mere opinions in a professor began
to be suggestive of lazy charlatanism, a time when all
this new cult of laboratory research, exact measuring,
statistical proof, historical evidence from first-hand
sources, was beginning to be demanded of the man who
professed anything.</p>

<p>This new sort of professor is quite apt to look on the
professional title as a joke, except in so far as it is a
distinction that carries real difference in wages. We
remember with what sturdy and solemn posing the professor
of yester-year would wear his titles; how deftly
he would correct the forgetful who lapsed into “Mr.”!
How he would announce himself as “Professor” with
such simple faith in its power to awe the unrefined!
Jawn was a perfect example of the newer school which,
we fear, has gone to the other extreme: it lacks terribly
in dignity; in fact, it suspects all dignity of a subtle
attempt to counterfeit intelligence—which is often the
case!—it is careless of mere external show, but it toils
like an Edison. It works hard when it works, and it
plays with the abandon of a nest of puppies; it smokes,
it drinks, it sings the wildest songs at purely male
meetings; it employs the colloquialisms of the street; it
tosses ball with the boys on the town lot; and, to oblige
a friend, it may stay up all night to play poker. And
on a holiday—which may be a night off, or a week-end—it
“cuts up” as if life were just beer and skittles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>This modern investigator-professor is the despair
of his European confrères, for, we must admit it, he
lacks culture. He knows so much of one thing that he
elects to know nothing of anything else, and cheerfully
owns up; indeed every other speech is a confession of
some sort of ignorance. And he lacks, he woefully
lacks polish; and often—although there are tailored
dandies among them—he lacks simple brushing and
scouring!</p>

<p>In his clinics Jawn Galloway tended his awkward flock
of wayward children—the mentally twisted and the
morally awry—with the dignity and the sweetness of a
Roman cardinal. He was genial and sympathetic, but
he was also strong and masterful. In the clinic no one
thought of him with other feeling than that of respect
for his wise mind, his deft hand, his atmosphere of confidence.
Over twenty thousand cases of wrong-mindedness
had come under his observation; he had held himself
to a laboratory vigil of from twelve to fourteen
hours a day for months at a time; and his “notes” had
formulated a new theory and practice in dealing with
the abnormal mind. In his clinics he was learned without
pedantry, and wise without snobbishness; but off
duty he was a perpetual sophomore—often, we fear,
equally as irritating to mature persons. His boisterous
laughter got on one’s nerves; his persistent doggerel,
his bubbling vivacity, his everlasting acting-a-part
stirred many a less highly strung person to combativeness.
“He a professor!” was the commonest remark
voiced by fellow vacationists who did not know of his
serious work. Of course they could not be aware that
his perfected scale for measuring the intelligence of
morons had brought him the approval of the most
serious-minded men in Europe and America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>His friends had often to apologize for Jawn Galloway,
for the type is not yet conventionalized. Our comic
papers continue to make the professor a deep-browed
simpleton, and our novels and our drama perpetuate the
picture; but that sort is as obsolete as Ichabod Crane.</p>

<p>“All right,” Richard nodded at Jawn’s persistent
flippancy. “I’ll wait. You’re resting—I know you!
You’re just skylarking to get your mind cleaned up.
I’ll wait. And one of these days Walter’s case will
seize you as it has me. You’ll get fascinated. I know
you! And then we’ll get something out of this visit;
you’ll sing another song instead——”</p>

<p>“Instead of just Lewis-carrolling, eh?” Jawn
laughed.</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Richard in turn. “I’ll wait.
But you’ll work for your wittles yet, old boy!”</p>

<p>Any further talk was cut short by the approach of
Walter.</p>

<p>“A left-tenant never made a good sailor,” said Jawn,
as he stepped on the yacht. “But here I am to serve
as ordered and, if necessary, go down with the ship.
Which is the saloon deck, and if this is it, where’s the
bar?”</p>

<p>The old sail lifted creakingly, the jib fluttered and
filled, and the <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> moved off smoothly for
its maiden trip on the waters of Lake Keuka.</p>

<p>Jawn was instructed in managing the starboard sidestays.
It was made clear to him that when the mainsail
was swung over on the port side the strain was
enough to split the mast unless he fastened the sustaining
rope, or “stay,” securely to the cleats before him.
When she came about he was to loosen the “stay” on
his side while Richard quickly secured the supporting
port “stay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“So I’m to loosen her stays, am I?” queried Jawn.</p>

<p>“Yes; and tighten them up, too, when we give you
the word, or that stick will snap off like a tree on the
path of a cyclone.”</p>

<p>“And when you say the word,” he repeated the
orders, “I’m to lace ’em up again, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s not the technical phrase,” laughed Richard,
“but it will do.”</p>

<p>“Another reason why a ship is called a she,” said
Jawn. “I think the minstrel troupes of the country
have missed that one.... It’s a strange thing, now,”
he mused, “for a modest young man like me to be
squatting here in the bodice of the ship—I hope I’m
using the proper language—sitting here in the bodice
of the ship with life and death in the balance. Still,
if I survive you, I’ll put the thing in proper nautical
language for the local papers: ‘Suddenly on Friday
last the good ship <i>What’s-her-name</i> capsized in a sudden
squall and was slowly strangled to death because no one
was able to reach her in time to loosen her stays.’”</p>

<p>Walter was very well pleased with his boat. Out in
the main body of water he tried her under all sorts of
conditions and had little brushes with other yachts, one
or two of which were “Class A scows,” and it seemed
always that the <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> could overhaul anything
either on short tack or long reach.</p>

<p>They tacked up the Lake under a stiff northeaster,
which gave Jawn plenty of practice in attending properly
to the “stays.” When they prepared to put about
and came back the wind dropped to a light breeze. So
they slipped along leisurely, taking over an hour to
round Bluff Point. During this time of lazy inactivity
Jawn, relieved of his duties, found his voice. He sang
songs, offered connundrums, stories and impromptu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
limericks. Several times during his chat he had forgotten
himself and called Richard by another name.
Walter became alert. When it had happened more
than once, he spoke up.</p>

<p>“Tryin’ to work me, are you?” he asked, “like you
do the women?”</p>

<p>Jawn did not see the point and asked him what in
the name of the seven devils he meant. Jawn Galloway
could be a very belligerent fellow at times.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothin’; on’y them names don’t fool me.”
Walter modified his tone discreetly; one could easily
take the spirit out of him. “I know he ain’t Richard,
and I know he ain’t the other one, either.”</p>

<p>“But I am the ‘other one,’ Walter,” Richard soothed
him.</p>

<p>“Like hell y’are!”</p>

<p>“Hey!” cried Jawn, searching about for a weapon.
“Drop that Billy Sunday talk or I’ll lam you over the
head with a——” he kicked about among several tools
lying at his feet—“where the blazes do you keep your
marlin-spikes? Have to have a marlin-spike. If I
were on land, now, I’d knock you down with my fist or
just kick you in the stomach, but the etiquette of the
sea demands marlin-spikes. What sort of a ship do
you call this?”</p>

<p>Walter did not know whether to be amused or
scared. Jawn could roar like Bottom, the weaver. But
he decided, finally, that the situation was not as perilous
as it sounded.</p>

<p>“He’s a big gun, he is—that fellow,” he went on,
with his thought on the name. “But you ain’t.”</p>

<p>“He has heard of my father, Jawn.” Richard turned
quickly. “You know I wrote you that he knew; he
found one of my cards on the steamer. The name was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
familiar to him, naturally; but he did not know that
father and I had the same names; and he did not
know of father’s death.”</p>

<p>“Everyone knows about it,” snapped Jawn.</p>

<p>“Of course, Walter,” Richard explained, “when
father died I was no longer a ‘junior.’ We have the
same name. Naturally you had never heard of me. I
have the distinguished name and have done nothing to
earn it. That’s why I am so contented with this
nondescript Mr. Richard. You can’t imagine how
pleasant it is not to be questioned and stared at. It’s
a dreadful nuisance to have distinguished parents.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t be disrespectful to the father of my
own offspring,” Jawn objected. “I’m getting to be
a notorious character, with my name in the print every
time a bug gets loose in somebody’s head. By the time
my children come along I’ll be as famous as Mr. Riley
whom they speak of so highly; I mean Mr. Riley who
keeps the hotel. Have you heard the song, Walter?
Well, you will.” And he sung it as only an Irishman
can.</p>

<p>So they were going to keep up the bluff, act it out
boldly; they were a daring lot, thought Walter; but
they couldn’t fool him.</p>

<p>“If he’s the B-Big Gun,” Walter persisted, “he’d
be r-rich.”</p>

<p>“No, Walter,” Richard was very patient. “That
was father’s money, not mine. He made it, not I.
Since I left college I have been making my own way.
Money doesn’t interest me, especially money I have
never earned. I couldn’t be happy with it; it would
be just a refined sort of slavery, and I have always
preferred to be free. Let’s don’t talk about it, if you
don’t mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“But I don’t see——” Walter began.</p>

<p>“Then shut up!” cried Jawn brutally.</p>

<p>“Jawn!” remonstrated Richard.</p>

<p>“By George, I’m forgetting myself!” Jawn showed
all his big teeth in an expansive grin. “Listen at me
shutting up the captain of the boat! It’s mutiny
they’ll be charging me with, and be hanging me at
the yardarm.” He cocked an eye aloft. “Is that her
yardarm, up there, sticking indecently out of the top
of her stays?”</p>

<p>The laughter that followed reassured Walter, but he
was careful not to bring up the topic of names again.
These were dangerous fellows and he had best keep in
with them. They could do what they pleased so long
as they left his preserves alone. The comforting thought
made him watch the shore carefully—they had turned
Bluff Point and were tacking into the Branch; and
after a time he was rewarded by a flutter of something
white on Phœbe’s porch. She had been watching for
him, too; and was waving a welcome home. The
breeze strengthened almost in answer to his own exultation,
and shortly they were dropping sails before the
Norris dock.</p>

<p>“Aye! aye! Captain Wells!” she called. “An’
how is everything for’ard?”</p>

<p>“Aw right!” he grinned.</p>

<p>“What’s your cargo—garden truck or cattle?”
She pretended not to distinguish the men at first.
“Ach! It’s the two gentlemen pirates out of the
movies! Ahoy, you two! What’s the latest news of
the police courts?”</p>

<p>Jawn put his hands together and megaphoned,
“Woman arrested for speeding. Her tongue ran away
with her head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>“That joke is in Genesis,” she retorted. It is, no
doubt, an aged masculine fling.</p>

<p>“Sure!” he called back as they stepped up on the
dock. “If Eve had been deaf and dumb we’d <i>all</i> be in
Paradise yet.”</p>

<p>“Ye devil!” she answered.</p>

<p>“You flatter the ould Boy,” said he.</p>

<p>“Ooh!” she shivered, “is he worse than you?”</p>

<p>“Much worse.”</p>

<p>“Don’t add to the terrors o’ death, man, but come in
and have a cup o’ tea. I set it a-brewin’ the moment I
saw you.”</p>

<p>Walter could not be persuaded to leave his boat until
every sail was furled and stowed away properly. He
took his time over it, too; for he knew instinctively that
he could not shine before Phœbe in the presence of such
glib gentlemen. They were shining gloriously when he
appeared, and their free laughter set him a-grinning
before he knew the cause.</p>

<p>“Walter,” Phœbe called, “you’re the jury. I’m
puttin’ these two good-lookin’ gentlemen through a
cross-examination. Up to this moment I’ve been the
judge and the prosecuting attorney and the jury, too;
but it’s tryin’ on the nerves. I’m glad you came in
when you did. The prisoners were insultin’ the Court
with indecent flattery. I need a tipstave and a sheriff’s
posse, I do. Sit ye there, boy; and decide fair. The
charge against these two malefactors——”</p>

<p>“I object, your honour,” interrupted Jawn. “We
can’t be malefactors until the charge is proved against
us. You’ll be prejudicing the jury against us before
he has finished his cup of tea. And besides, I told the
jury to shut up this afternoon, so we’ll need all the close
decisions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“Who’s tryin’ this case?” demanded Phœbe. “The
charge is gallivantin’ with malice aforethought.”</p>

<p>“Gallivanting with intent to kill,” agreed Jawn.
“We plead guilty.”</p>

<p>“Is this your first offence?” asked the “judge.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” ejaculated Jawn. “It’s my seventy-seventh!
Do you take me for a fledgling? I’ve got
records to prove it. My dear lady, I shaved when I
was eleven.”</p>

<p>“May it please the Court,” Richard spoke with the
gravest deference, and told of the passions of Jawn as
illustrated in his forthcoming book, “Love Limericks of
a Left-tenant.”</p>

<p>“Out with them, man; out with them!” demanded
Phœbe.</p>

<p>“Some of them need expurgating badly,” warned
Richard.</p>

<p>“The Court must be entertained,” said Phœbe, “even
at the expense of a little vulgarity. Proceed, sir.”</p>

<p>“The saddest case,” Jawn searched his memory, “is
that of a lady of my college days whose name I did not
know, but who welcomed and nobly assisted my young
aspirations; who, in short, taught me much.”</p>

<p>Then he recited the “epitaph” of the lass who
caught his heart during the early weeks of his Freshmanhood,
who led him on outrageously, who looked the
part of an under-grad in the high school, but who
turned out to be the wife of the Dean!</p>

<p>“These college professors will often fool you,” Jawn
explained. “They marry the cutest little springers
with the feathers still on their legs——”</p>

<p>“Don’t remind me of my Orpingtons!” cried Phœbe.</p>

<p>“—And with round little blushing peach-blow faces!
It would fool anyone. You see, they are a shy lot all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
their young days, the professors are, the years when
they should have been prancing about colt-like and finding
out things. So they fly from the sight of women
and sit in their cells and grow ogre-eyed and brainy.
Then late in life they slide out in the twilight and grab
a Young One. There ought to be a law against it.”</p>

<p>The charge of “gallivantin’” was amply proved, at
least against Jawn, by his own series of poetic
confessions.</p>

<p>“And you say you’ve already had seventy-seven affairs
with the ladies!” Phœbe expressed her incredulity.</p>

<p>“He’s on his seventy-seventh now,” corrected Richard.</p>

<p>“H-m!” Phœbe eyed him. “It’s not me you’re
after makin’ eyes at, is it?”</p>

<p>“I decline to commit myself,” said Jawn solemnly.
“I appeal to the legal decency of the jury that a man
can’t be compelled to bear testimony against himself.”</p>

<p>The jury shifted about uneasily. The jury was
obviously disturbed. Like many unhappy persons on
this earth, Walter understood everything in the situation
but the humour of it, and so missed its very salt.</p>

<p>“The jury will please mind its own business,” the
Court admonished; “I merely remind the prisoner that
if he tries any gallivantin’ with this Court he’ll find himself
muzzled and manacled in holy matrimony before he
can think up a rhyme for ‘God-help-me.’ This Court
finds the single state very depressing, and is gettin’ entirely
too old to miss a chance. All of which reminds
me, Jawn, that you must have begun early. Have you
any early records?”</p>

<p>Richard laughed appreciatively. He knew what was
coming.</p>

<p>“Oh, a very good record,” said Jawn. “It is the
only one about whose ranking I feel positively sure. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
call it ‘My Firth,’ for I was entirely too young to speak
plainly. The official account goes this way,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“To myself on the day of my birth</div>
<div class="verse">I lisped, ‘What a charming young nurth!’</div>
<div class="indent2">And then when she faced me</div>
<div class="indent2">And frankly embraced me,</div>
<div class="verse">I remarked, ‘Not tho bad, thith ol’ Earth!’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Oh, beautiful! beautiful!” Phœbe clapped her
hands. “I could love you for that one, Jawn.”</p>

<p>“It is strikingly optimistic,” commented Richard.
“‘Not tho bad, thith ol’ Earth!’ And it is absolutely
characteristic of Jawn.”</p>

<p>“I can believe it!”—this from Phœbe. “He was an
imp of a lad from the cradle!”</p>

<p>“Jawn’s the only specimen of pure lover left from
the Middle Ages,” said Richard, “for he believes with
Dante, Petrarch and the rest that true love dies with
marriage.”</p>

<p>“Devil a bit!” Jawn remonstrated. “There’s often
a fine spark of it left——”</p>

<p>“For some other fellow,” Phœbe broke in quickly.
“My own thought, exactly!” he added, and joined
with Phœbe in good hearty Irish laughter.</p>

<p>“Order!” suddenly cried the Court, pounding her
tea-cup on the table. “What d’ye mean by gettin’ the
Court to commit herself like that!”</p>

<p>After much more such give and take the Court
arraigned the prisoners and charged the jury. She
acknowledged that the evidence was all against them from
the start, but that long acquaintance with a criminal
world had made her soft; besides, they had drunk her
tea and had laughed at her jokes, and no Irishman could
ever hang a man he had once laughed with. So she
would recommend them to the mercy of the jury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>The jury was absolutely non-committal. Whether it
was surly, sleepy or speechless no one could say.</p>

<p>“Wan’ ’o see you alone,” it muttered to Phœbe; and
nothing else would it admit.</p>

<p>“The jury can’t come to a unanimous verdict,” the
Court announced; “so if the prisoners will kindly run
out and play, we’ll reason with the obstinate members.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, boy?” she asked when they
were alone.</p>

<p>In semi-incoherent language he poured forth his feelings
about the two men whose cleverness with words had
been hoodwinking everybody. With her mind alert to
sift out all the evidence he could produce, she presented
a laughing mocking face. But she could not joke him
out of his convictions.</p>

<p>The “card,” which he always carried about with him,
was produced and partially explained. Richard’s latest
version, for some occult reason of his own, Walter
did not tell.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” ejaculated Phœbe as she read the name.
“The villain! Why, this man is dead; I read about it
in the papers several years ago; he went down with his
whole family in a shipwreck. What do you think it
means, boy?”</p>

<p>“Dunno.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she assumed a cheerful tone, “perhaps it is
only a lark. They are a great pair of boys. They
would not stop at anything.” The memory of their
skylarking came back to brighten her face. “I haven’t
had such a good laugh since—since Seth got into the
paint house.”</p>

<p>She hummed about her little dining-room, putting
away the tea-things, and considered the meaning of Mr.
Richard’s assumption of the name of a dead man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Some years ago a sleek-looking chap with no obvious
occupation had rented a house on Main Street, made
the acquaintance of important citizens and had continued
for months to be unnaturally Christian. Everyone
in the village had made a guess as to the exact sort
of swindle he would eventually introduce, so that when
he finally began to talk rubber trees in Madagascar the
laugh was so hearty and universal that he left without
offering to let anybody in on the ground floor.</p>

<p>Would it be rubber trees in Madagascar, or just a
plain case of “worthless cheque”? Or would it be
“power of attorney” with one or the other of them
getting the “heiress”? Phœbe hoped it would be the
latter. “I’ve handled a lunatic,” she said to herself,
“which makes me hanker after the intelligent even if
they be criminal.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll keep our eyes open, boy,” said Phœbe;
“but whatever you do don’t let on you suspect anything.
Meet a confidence man with confidence. You’ll
spoil everything if you go about like you were this
afternoon lookin’ as glum as cold beeswax. Didn’t you
see how I was jollyin’ ’em along? Did you think I
meant half what I said? Of course I didn’t. It was to
make them feel easy. The devil was never yet fooled by
a pious face.”</p>

<p>Phœbe understood Walter better than anyone else.
This theory of her hilarious enjoyment filled him with
peace and sent him home with his head in the air.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>HARDY PERENNIALS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry’s</span> long walk the previous evening had given
her an excuse to have her coffee and rolls served
in her room. She did not want to admit even to
herself that she was nervously apprehensive of committing
herself in the presence of Richard, but an
undefined fear of him had quenched some of her
natural Virginia boldness. With so many willing
blacks about the place breakfast in one’s room was
an easy matter at “Red Jacket”; and it was too
common a custom to create comment. She might
avoid luncheon, too, but she knew that she could not
hide indefinitely; so she came down.</p>

<p>Some of her indefinite fears became definite when
she faced Richard at table. The men were full of
their sail and of their good times at Phœbe Norris’.
That permitted her to watch them unobserved.
Occasionally, however, Richard glanced at her as if
curious about her expressionless silence, but, she admitted
ruefully, he was unconscious of his effect on her,
as unconscious as a contented kitten. He was a
terribly satisfied person! That was due, she supposed,
to his frank egoism, but whatever the cause she felt
helpless before it. Could nothing move this man?
His peaceful blue eyes fronted the world too serenely
for her comfort. “Sea blue imperturbable,” she
thought, purposely twisting Carlyle’s phrase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>There was one way to move him, but that would
move him out of the county on the next train—to
make eyes at him. She would never do that; never!
Her lips closed firmly and a snap came into her eyes at
the very thought of it. Nevertheless, she felt cornered,
and it almost angered her. Here was the tragic dilemma
of sex: she must not make the slightest advance, and
unless she did, this man would never be budged.</p>

<p>She thought of all her fine speeches to him about the
joy of being treated not as a woman but as a human
being, but she did not care to remember his enthusiastic
reception of this point of view. Other men had
fluttered and looked unutterable male things at her
and she had been annoyed. Why was this calm gentleman
built on such an unflutterable mould? Jawn,
now, was flirting with her this very minute; Richard—the
thought of Richard flirting with anyone was so
preposterous that she unconsciously smiled.</p>

<p>The eager Jawn was quick to pounce on that smile.
He took it to himself and ogled back.</p>

<p>“Huh!” he puffed; “I worked hard for that!
I thought you were going to walk in your sleep during
the whole meal. It took five exceptionally clever
remarks, each guaranteed to raise a laugh, to bring one
little smile. Do we owe for last week’s board, or something?
Or have you missed a solid silver spoon?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” Jerry became a penitent hostess;
“have you been talking to me? I haven’t heard
a word. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>The laugh went against Jawn.</p>

<p>“The seventy-seventh will be no madrigal,” Richard
told him; “it will be just one more limerick, Jawn.”</p>

<p>“Please tell me about the madrigal?” Jerry asked
politely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>Jawn pretended reluctance, but when urged confessed
frankly his life-long hunt for a soul-mate, and of
his belief that in Jerry he had found his El Dorado.
It was ridiculous, of course, and Jawn could always be
trusted to put his fun unequivocally. Mrs. Wells was
delighted, especially with the Love Limericks; and
Richard’s joy in his friend’s achievements was quite
open; but Jerry, to her own astonishment, was
annoyed. It was like joking at death in the presence
of the bereaved.</p>

<p>And Richard’s off-hand discussion of the possibility
of Jerry’s surrendering as a charitable means of putting
an end to a flow of bad verse—that was unendurable.
Fortunately, the inward perturbation was not outwardly
disclosed; it was a simple matter to make a
coldly apt comment, plead “business,” and withdraw
to her room.</p>

<p>Jawn stared after her.</p>

<p>“Did you see how cut up she was?” he cried.
“Ah, lad, it’s no joking matter. I’ve got a fine
chance yet! A fine chance!”</p>

<p>Jerry had hardly crossed the threshold and heard
him distinctly. She heard Richard’s reply, too.</p>

<p>“Possibly, Jawn! Possibly! Undoubtedly something
moved her—moved her off without her dessert.
I never saw her quite so confused, but I’m afraid the
elephantine character of your wooing frightened her
off.”</p>

<p>“Jealous!” cried Jawn.</p>

<p>“I envy you only that final limerick, Jawn. I know
it’s going to be a corker.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Wells, I appeal to you as a woman of experience,”
Jawn persisted. “Do you think I have a
chance?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>Jerry did not wait to hear her mother’s opinion.
Although her more sensible self told her that it was
childish to take offence at anything so obviously good-natured,
the blinding anger that seized her drove her
out of hearing quickly. The thought of staying a
moment longer frightened her. She knew that she was
on the verge of breaking down and spilling out a
surprising torrent of invective against poor unoffending
Jawn. And that, she had sense enough left to know,
would be fatal. It would be worse than making eyes!</p>

<p>But if she had stayed a moment or two longer she
would have been shocked into frigidity. To the innocent
jesting Walter contributed a serious note.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Wells was assuring them that she would
play no favourites, an interruption of Richard’s had
led Jawn to say:</p>

<p>“You keep out of this. I won’t have any interference
from big handsome men with romantic blue eyes
and perfect teeth. What you need is a woman like
Mrs. Norris to let you down a peg daily, to remind you
of your grovelling insignificance. Go to the widow,
thou sluggard.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been,” laughed Richard; “we quarrel beautifully!”</p>

<p>“Splendid! A fine sign! True love guaranteed!”</p>

<p>“’S not so!” blurted Walter; “Jerry and him’s
got it all f-fixed up.”</p>

<p>George Alexander had caught Mrs. Wells’ attention
and at that moment was getting his directions for dinner.
She had not been accustomed to attend very
carefully to remarks from Walter, so the colloquy that
followed was lost on her.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” said Jawn quietly.</p>

<p>Richard looked on curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“G-got it all fixed up, them two.”</p>

<p>“They have, have they? How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Jerry told me.”</p>

<p>“When was all this?”</p>

<p>“Last night. She said h-him and her, they were
goin’ to get married. Said they h-had it all f-fixed
up.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Richard.</p>

<p>“Mebbe oughtn’t t’ have said nothin’,” Walter was
a little frightened at his own temerity. “But ’at’s
what she s-said, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Jawn whistled.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pretty mess!” said he; “here’s a how d’
you do! Let’s get this straight, young man; do you
mean to tell us that——”</p>

<p>“S-sh!” warned Richard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells had dismissed George Alexander, and
was turning inquiringly upon the group.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” she asked. The sudden
silence had attracted her attention.</p>

<p>Richard stepped quickly into the breach. “Walter
thinks he has the fastest boat on the Lake,” he explained,
and went into a voluble tribute to <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i>.</p>

<p>“Why, Richard!” Mrs. Wells interrupted. “How
red your face is!”</p>

<p>“He’s blushing for shame,” said Jawn, “for shame
at the thought of how easy it’ll be to take the cup
away from those other poor yachtsmen. And well you
may, Richard! And well you may!”</p>

<p>Richard’s blushes threatened to be permanent.
Throughout the luncheon and several hours afterward
he glowed like a burning sumac bush. While anything
from Walter should be taken with something more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
than the proverbial grain of salt, yet he had succeeded
in producing a most confusing mental state in Richard.
Jawn’s gentle raillery after luncheon did nothing to
help matters, and all of Richard’s many explanations
of the possible twist in Walter’s meaning merely added
further confusion.</p>

<p>He sought an excuse early to be alone, and for an
hour or two hovered about the house waiting for
Jerry to appear. Some of his lost shyness came
back to benumb him and prevent his sending for her
outright. Indeed, once when he thought he heard her
coming down the stairs he grew so fearful of meeting
her that he slipped out of a rear door and fled into
a path that led to the garden.</p>

<p>Walter was a fool, “a young damned fool,” to use
Jawn’s technical expression. Why should one take
seriously the act of an idiot? Why, indeed! She
could not have possibly said anything of the sort, even
in fun. At any angle that he looked at it such a conversation
between Walter and Jerry was unbelievable.
Thunderation! What an idea to put into a man’s head!</p>

<p>But to one’s own brother may not one make confessions?
He had never been a sister, himself, so
he could not guess their habits; but hadn’t he read
somewhere in books that sometimes, especially at night,
they talk things out frankly with the brother? Which
only shows how far his mind had swung out of its
normal course. Who could fancy anyone of Jerry’s
independence making sentimental confessions to a
half-witted brother?</p>

<p>“G’ mawnin’, Mr. Richard! G’ mawnin’!”</p>

<p>George Alexander’s white poll rose slowly out of
a hydrangea bush wherein he seemed almost to have
been hiding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“Good-morning, George Alexander,” Richard responded
eagerly. He was glad of the chance to talk to
someone not of the immediate family. “That hydrangea
is a bigger plant than you are!”</p>

<p>“Tol’rable big, sir! Tol’rable big! But up on de
hill yondah, we’s got young gi-unts. Trees, I calls ’em—reg’lar
hydranj’a trees!”</p>

<p>“You’ve been here all your life, haven’t you,
George?” Richard asked.</p>

<p>“All my life—so fah!” he laughed; “I was bo’n
hyah an’ I plum reckon ’at some day, when I gets tir’d
idlin’ ’round, I’ll jess natchully die hyah.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see you idling around much. You’re
always busy at something. Do you have charge of the
gardens, too?”</p>

<p>“Yassuh,” he nodded his old white head sagely.
“I’m de boss! De black boys do de easy workin’
<i>’round</i>, an’ I do all de heavy lookin’ <i>ovah</i>!” George
Alexander’s laugh was a low, cackling “Hyah!
Hyah!” He punctuated his speeches with it, a notice
in each instance of a humorous remark, a laugh exactly
timed to give one a chance to “see the point.” In
these days George Alexander was a great curiosity, one
of the very last specimens of the old-time “darkey,”
intelligent, nimble-witted, outspoken but diplomatic,
loyal, an efficient manager, never servile but absolutely
determined to be nothing more than a perfect servant.</p>

<p>“Do you run the vineyards, too?” Richard asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>“Mistah Richud,” George Alexander assumed an air
of great seriousness, “I nevah could understand why
<i>any</i>body would prefeh to <i>stan’</i> when dey could talk jess
as well <i>settin’</i>! Hyah! Hyah!”</p>

<p>His solemn face broke forth into radiant lines as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
pointed towards two excellent rustic benches facing each
other.</p>

<p>“Yassuh!” he came back to Richard’s question after
he had spread himself comfortably on one of the seats.
“Yassuh! I take charge of de grapes. An’ I used to
take charge of de apples, too; but Mrs. Wells, she done
let dem apples all go. Dey ain’t so much in de grapes
as dey used to be, but apples—why, dem apples, Mistuh
Richud, was all pure gold. I tol’ her she make a
big mistake to let ’em go. An’ Mistah Buttuhwo’th
tol’ her. Mistah Buttuhwo’th’s from Philadelphia, an’
he knows all about apples. He loves apples so much
he says it’s a’mos’ wicked to eat one. Hyah! Hyah!
He knows apples well enough to call ’em by dar fus’
names, Mistah Buttuhwo’th does; hyah! hyah!”</p>

<p>“Did you have any trouble with the apples,
George?”</p>

<p>“Trouble?” George straightened up as much as
his old back would allow. “Apples ain’t no trouble,
Mistah Richud. Jes’ spray ’em propuhly, dat’s all dey
asks. Spray ’em to kill de fungus while de trees is still
a-winterin’, an’ spray ’em to kill de Hosay scale befo’
de blossom comes, an’ spray ’em to kill de red-bug after
de fruit is a-growin’, an’ spray ’em to kill de cuddlin’
moth all de middle of de summer, an’ spray ’em to kill
de tent caterpillar when de fruit is mos’ grown, an’ spray
’em to kill de rest of ’em when de fruit is done. An’
even den if yo’ fin’ youse’f restless at night an’ can’t git
to sleep, you’d better git up an’ spray ’em agin fo’ luck!
Hyah! Hyah! Trouble? Dey ain’t no trouble ’bout
growin’ <i>apples</i>; dey jes’ grows natcherel de way de
Lawd intended; de on’y thing dat breaks yo’ back is
killin’ dem consarned, evahlastin’ <i>bugs</i>.... Hyah!
Hyah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>Richard paid his full tribute of applause and then
asked, “Why did Mrs. Wells let the apples go? Didn’t
they pay?”</p>

<p>Richard inquired out of no thought to pry. The old
man was so interesting that it was a temptation to start
him going.</p>

<p>“Pay? Why in <i>co’se</i> dey paid! We was gittin’ fo’
thousand barrels o’ puhfeck fruit after Mistah Buttuhwo’th
come up hyah and tol’ us how to do it. Used to
be gittin’ on’y about fi’ hundud. An’ Mistah Buttuhwo’th,
he’d take ’em down to Philadelphia an’ put ’em in
his big ice-house and set back and wait till all de apples
was eat up an’ folks got a-hankerin’ fo’ one—Mistah
Buttuhwo’th says dah’s a lot o’ Adam left in folks yit!
Hyah! Hyah!—an’ den when dey’s ready to pay ’mos’
anything for even a Ben Davis, he brings out our genuine
Baldwins, an’ <i>pow</i>! de price goes sky-<i>yut</i>in’!”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you keep the orchards?”</p>

<p>“Dah yo’ gits me, Mistah Richud.” He shook his
white head. “’Ca’se why? ’Ca’se you asks me to
unraffle de hardest knot de good Lawd evah tie up.
Does <i>any</i>body know, Mistah Richud, why a woman’d
do <i>dis-heah</i>,” he waved a hand dramatically, “rathe ’n
<i>dat-dere</i>?” His hand moved between the two imaginary
situations. “Mrs. Wells, she sez we was a-sprayin’
too much. She sez we’d been a-killin’ grubs
for so many yeahs that dey’d done forget how to get
borned, mebbe. In co’se I tol’ her diff’rent, an’ Mistah
Buttuhwo’th nearly get down an’ prayed to her about it,
but she ’lowed she’d give dem pore trees a rest. Dey
wa’n’t no ’jections, fah as I could observe, from de
niggahs what had de sprayin’ job! Hyah! Hyah!
Pow’ful sympathizin’ dey was to dem pore trees!
Hyah! Hyah!... Well, Mistah Buttuhwo’th, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
says de nex’ crop would be all bug-ged, an’ dey was all
bug-ged; an’ he says de nex’ crop ’ud be buggeder an’,
sho’ ’nuf, dey <i>was</i> buggeder!”</p>

<p>“But couldn’t they be sprayed again and put into
shape?”</p>

<p>“Puffekly! Puffekly! Dat’s ’xactly what Mistah
Hopkins did who bought ’em. But Mrs. Wells ’low’d
dat after all her kindness she wouldn’t have nothin’ mo
to do with trees what was as ongrateful as dem trees.
An’ don’t yo’ think yo’se’f, Mistah Richud, dat it was
kind o’ low-down <i>onery</i> o’ dem trees? Hyah! Hyah!”</p>

<p>“But I suppose Mrs. Wells got a good price for the
orchard.” Richard tried to give George Alexander a
chance to make up for his indirect criticism.</p>

<p>“Nuffin’ to say, Mistah Richud,” George Alexander
assured him solemnly. “I’s got a mudder an’ a fahder
an’ a whole pa’sel progenitohs waitin’ up dah,” he
pointed piously above, “an’ dey see me gettin’ near de
point o’ followin’ along, an’ meetin’ up wid ’em; but,
Mistah Richud, if I opens my mouth on de sale-price
ob dat o’cha’d my talk would be so blasphemious dat
I’d sho’ have to dispoint dem people up dah!”</p>

<p>Richard thought he would be on safe ground to ask
about the grapes.</p>

<p>“Po’rly, Mistah Richud, po’rly,” George Alexander
pulled a long face. “Not ’nuff blue-stone. A spray
what’s all water, I says, ain’t no spray ’tall.... It’s
a mighty good thing us black folks is all rich.”</p>

<p>There was a joke here, no doubt, thought Richard.
George Alexander’s expressionless face seemed to be
waiting for the “interlocutor” to bring the end-man
out.</p>

<p>“Well,” asked Richard good-naturedly, “what’s the
answer, Mr. Bones?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Ya-as,” George Alexander drew in a deep, satisfied
breath, “<i>we’s</i> all right. If anything ebber happens to
de Wellses, <i>we’s</i> fixed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve all saved up money, have you?”</p>

<p>“When we’s bo’n,” explained George Alexander, “an’
gits big ’nuff to work ’round, Mrs. Wells puts us on
de pay-roll, an’ as long as we stays with her we draws
half and she keeps half for us. When she dies or when
dis place breaks up we gits all our savin’s back an’
int’rest on ’em. We’s all got our books to show how
much. I’s been on dat pay-roll fo’ fifty yeahs, Mistah
Richud. I’s a rich man if I stays on here, an’ I guess
I can leave my chillun’ sumpin’, ’case anything
happens.”</p>

<p>There were thirty negroes working here and there on
the Wells’ land, George Alexander told Richard; entirely
too many, of course, but it had always been the
custom of the Wells family to look out for its blacks.
All this explained the absolute absence of “labour
troubles” for so many generations. Any capable
negro was assured of an easy livelihood, care in illness,
and a safe pension.</p>

<p>“An’ what mo’ does anybody want in dis yeah
world?” asked George Alexander. “I’d be mighty
thankful, Mistah Richud, to be shu’ o’ dat much up <i>dah</i>!
Hyah! Hyah!”</p>

<p>In his artless way George Alexander had thrown considerable
light on Red Jacket under Mrs. Wells’ management.
Richard recalled one of Jerry’s illustrations
of her mother’s obstinacy whereby the year’s grape crop
had been lost. No doubt unrecorded history had similar
stories with similar losses. Evidently there were
funds enough to cover these bad balances and keep the
big place going; if not Jerry would soon discover what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
she got to the bottom of the documents placed in her
charge.</p>

<p>Jerry would sift things to the bottom, he felt sure.
There was a certain satisfaction in lingering on the
thought of Jerry’s substantial character. She had the
mother’s persistence and will, and, he smiled to himself,
a little of the mother’s obstinacy. How he had misjudged
her at first! But there was nothing surprising
in that to Richard. Having practised open-mindedness
all his life he was aware of the commonness of mistaken
judgments. It is only the bigoted and partisan who
experience infallibility.</p>

<p>His pleasant musings were interrupted by George
Alexander.</p>

<p>“But we’s makin’ a big go ob dem hahdy puh-ren-nials,
Mistah Richud, a great go!” he was saying, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>“Dey mus’ be ’bout twenty ob dem black boys up dah
now, a-workin’ an’ a-hoein’ an’ a-prunin’. We’s
su’ten’y got de prize crop o’ phlox an’ yaller daisy!
Hyah! Hyah! Dey’s a whole mountain o’ snapdragon,
blues an’ yallers an’ pinks an’ whites. You
don’t know o’ any localities, Mistah Richud, what’s hungerin’
now fo’ a mess o’ peonies, does yo’? ’Ca’se if
yo’ do, it’d be de Lawd’s mercy to let ’em loose up on
dat hill yondah. An’ hollyhocks! Lawd! If we
could on’y send hollyhocks down to Mistah Buttuhwo’th’s
big ice-house in Philadelphia, we’d no need o’ no
apple o’cha’d, Mistah Richud. Hyah! Hyah! But
I’s not seen many puhsens hyeah-’bouts fallin’ ober demselves
to buy up our hollyhock crop, Mistah Richud.
Hyah! Hyah! Not so many, Mistah Richud!”</p>

<p>There was always money enough for spray and soil
for the hardy perennials, George Alexander averred.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
And there was always a strong demand for labour to thin
out this group here and transplant there, and prune
and cultivate and graft. The seed-pods were collected
as if they were gold-dust; and bulbs were dug up,
wrapped and saved; and slips were cut and planted in
fresh places; and paths were made, hedges constructed
for background effect and natural stone walls built for
trailing vines, and so on and so on.</p>

<p>No doubt it was magnificent. Mr. Richard could see
for himself. The whole hillside had been turned into
a garden which renewed itself each year and flowered
from early May when the first yellow forsythia sprang
forth until the last cosmos had died and the hydrangeas
had bent their dark heads. From the Lake it waved its
flaunting colours, and visitors had motored many miles
for a sight of it.</p>

<p>But it buttered no parsnips, said George Alexander.
Flowers were all right, but you couldn’t barrel them
and send them to Mr. Butterworth in Philadelphia.
George Alexander loved beauty, but he had been trained
in the practical business of grape and apple farming.
Grapes and apples should come first, he thought, not
hardy perennials.</p>

<p>Of course he had not meant to be critical; but he had
lived with the Wells family all his life; it was his family
as much as anybody’s and therefore he was going to
stick up for it even if the family did not.</p>

<p>Oh, Mrs. Wells knew how he felt. He had always
been frank and straightforward on the business end of
“Red Jacket.” But the whole trouble was that she
avoided him. He was her black conscience that always
reminded her of her sins; so she cleverly got him off the
subject, or sent him on business at the other end of
things, or claimed to have a headache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>George Alexander laughed shrewdly.</p>

<p>And the reason he had taken Mr. Richard aside to
tell him the story was to get a helper. He had noticed
that Mrs. Wells thought very highly of Mr. Richard’s
judgment. Well, George Alexander considered that it
wouldn’t do any harm to strengthen that judgment with
his own!</p>

<p>And all the while Richard had fancied that this garrulous
old darkey was just talking aimlessly! The
craft of the old fellow!</p>

<p>There were other reasons, George Alexander was saying,
while he scratched his white poll thoughtfully; but—he
hesitated—but he’d let them wait. Yet it seemed
to him that if things kept drifting along the way he had
observed them—he hesitated again and winked a jovial
eye at Mr. Richard—well, he’d better not pursue that
topic, as it was none of his business, but—he hoped—well,
he wouldn’t just say what his hopes were.</p>

<p>The chuckles and “Hyah hyahs” of the old fellow
were meant undoubtedly to be significant of something.
Richard’s ears burned at the thought of what he might
be meaning, but he thrust it aside swiftly as too absurd.
Meanwhile something had to be done to stop the criminal
grin on that black face, so Richard rose hastily and
claimed that he must go immediately and look at the
hardy perennials.</p>

<p>“You’ll like ’em, Mistah Richud,” George Alexander
straightened out his face; “they’ll tickle yo’ eye like
rainbows on a soap-bubble; but jess yo’ keep yo’ head,
Mistah Richud, an’ every time yo’ shout, ‘Be-yut-i-ful!’
jess yo’ say to you’self ‘Grapes fust! Grapes
fust!’ Hahdy puh-rennials is all right. I’s got no
’jection to dem—in dere own propuh place; although
I don’t mind sayin’ to yo’, Mistah Richud, dat de on’y<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
hahdy puh-rennials dat I see any use in is dem combs
an’ hahr brushes dat de Penn Yan drug stores brings
out ob dere hidin’-places and puts conspicuous on de
front counters ebry Christmas time. Hyah! Hyah!
Dey su’ten’y am <i>hahdy</i>, an’ dey shu’ is puh-rennial!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>MICHAELMAS DAISY AND ROSE-BUGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> hedge, cut to resemble the old-fashioned
pillar-and-ball entrance to a driveway, welcomed one
into the beginning of the gardens. Beyond the hedge
the path curved abruptly, and a six-foot wall with high
terraces beyond filled the view. Blue masses of sentinel-like
larkspur in mounting tiers gave the first greeting.
Here was the evidence of an intelligent planning to
capture the eye right at the beginning and make one
eager to follow the curving path to see what would be
beyond. Instinctively Richard stopped and uttered
the prophesied word, “Beautiful!” The thought of
“Grapes fust!” never intruded.</p>

<p>At the curve the walk widened into a little circle of
violet phlox, walled-up on all sides except towards the
sun and towards the narrow arched opening that led
farther on. The walls were not high and were almost
concealed by the climbing blue clematis; beyond them
was slightly higher ground crowded with blue harebell,
and farther back a battalion of Chinese larkspur. Blue
snapdragon—giants, every one—sprang out here and
there, and a bevy of smaller border flowers filled in
the scheme—all blue. An old-fashioned hickory settle
invited one to sit and enjoy; and near it had been
planted nests of the more fragrant plants, and borders
of blue campanula, Jacob’s ladder and creeping phlox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>Richard sat on the settle and admired. “Beautiful!”
he exclaimed again and again. It was a bower of blue—blue
and purple and violet and lavender and red-blue;
but nothing clashed or interfered with the dominant
cerulean note; there was enough rich green to separate
what would otherwise be jarring shades.</p>

<p>What a puzzling mute Jerry Wells could be when
she chose! In all their chatty hours together there
had been hardly a word about this; and undoubtedly
here was but the vestibule of the gardens. “Red
Jacket” should be discovered for oneself, she always
said. Well, it was better so; half the delight in life is
the unanticipated joys.</p>

<p>Green shrubs blocked the view through the arch,
but one turn—the garden was a maze of turns—and
behold, a diminutive bridge and a slender spring-fed
rivulet, and beyond, in clumps and patches raised at
various elevations by hidden walls, blooms of delicate
pink: Canterbury bells, hollyhock, phlox, gladiolus,
lupine, foxglove.</p>

<p>The pink bower was larger than the blue and was,
therefore, not to be taken in at once. Curving paths
appeared leading to a series of surprises, a sward of rest-harrow
here and a bevy of tall canna there, but no alien
colour had been permitted to spoil the general tone.</p>

<p>Just over a hedge Richard heard voices and the
light-hearted laugh of negroes at work. Someone in
authority was giving directions; it sounded like Jerry’s
voice, so he chanted the family song, the two musical
notes, the fifth and the third of the scale, “Hel-lo!”</p>

<p>The song came back, softly wafted over the green
barrier, “Hel-lo!”—the “lo” held until it diminished
into a whisper.</p>

<p>Eagerly he sought a path, singing the call occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
as he missed his way and getting the response every
time. The path that he chose dropped down broad
flagstone steps and then rose. He had completed a
half-circle before he came upon a hillside of yellow
blooms, gaillardia, black-eyed Susans, and dahlia. They
fairly shouted at him, especially the yellow daisies, but
he did not see them at all. “Hel-lo!” he sang in his
flutest tones; and “Hel-lo!” came back almost at his
feet. He found himself standing on a six-foot wall at
the top of a set of narrow stone steps; below him
Mrs. Wells was engaging the attention of several
negroes with wheelbarrows, spades and a whole galaxy
of garden tools.</p>

<p>“Hel-lo!” she sang up at him.</p>

<p>Richard was astonished at his own disappointment.
Courage to face folks was not always ready at call, and
at this precise hour he felt no terrifying shyness. He
was not one to be courageous at a moment’s notice; his
ridiculous left-handedness had a habit of visiting him
when he least desired it; it was a pity that Jerry was
not present now when he felt so able.</p>

<p>But to Mrs. Wells he showed no sign either of
surprise or disappointment.</p>

<p>“Hel-lo!” he sang cheerfully; and came down the
steep irregular steps.</p>

<p>“I’ll never be kind to a Michaelmas daisy again,”
she greeted him, trowel in hand.</p>

<p>“Are they ungrateful?” he asked and looked at
the black-eyed Susans. “They seem very sweet and
ingratiating to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean the rudbeckia,” she laughed.
“They are just as bad, but——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” Richard interrupted. “Introduce me
to this bad rude Becky; I don’t know her at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“The black-eyed Susans!” she laughed at his
ignorance. “You are staring at them. We gardeners
call them rudbeckias. You just daren’t let them go to
seed; they’d run over the whole place. Just look how
they have multiplied since I have been away! But
they’re not half so bad as the Michaelmas daisy, who
have no right to be in the yellow garden at all.”</p>

<p>“Why, pray?” Richard searched about for the
offending member.</p>

<p>“Because they are blue.”</p>

<p>“H-m! Blue!” he still looked about him. “Perhaps
I’m growing blinded by all the beauty hereabouts,
but I don’t see anything blue.”</p>

<p>She laughed again, delighted with his stupidity.</p>

<p>“If you look into those barrows,” she pointed,
“you’ll see the blue truants. They belong in the blue
beds, but they got loose somehow and cropped up all
over the place. I’ve been spending my hours hunting
them out. Don’t you see where we have been digging?”</p>

<p>Then Richard saw the great gashes, and admitted
his folly. Everything was so wonderful and colossal he
had not been able to see the defects, he told her. By
this time his eye was taking in the spreading expanse
of yellow field.</p>

<p>“‘And then my heart with rapture fills,’” he quoted,
“‘and dances with the——’ I don’t see any daffodils.”</p>

<p>Even the negroes laughed at this.</p>

<p>“Have I said something stupid?” he asked. “Don’t
blame me; blame Wordsworth. I’m sure he said
daffodils—but perhaps he only did it for the rhyme. If
Jawn were here he’d make a limerick to fit black-eyed
Susans.... But just why are daffodils so funny?”</p>

<p>“Daffodils are a spring flower, my dear Richard,”
Mrs. Wells began to explain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“Of course they are!” Richard remembered.
“Wretchedly stupid of me. But I never can keep pace
with that kind of information. I never know when it
is kite time or top time.... We’ll have to bring
Wordsworth up to the minute. How is this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“And then with joy my heart goes crazy</div>
<div class="verse">And dances with the Michaelmas daisy?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Not mine!” Mrs. Wells shook her head and
flourished the trowel.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he corrected himself, “your version should be,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“And then with anger my mind goes crazy</div>
<div class="verse">And trowels away at the Michaelmas daisy!</div>
</div></div>

<p>“It isn’t as smooth as one of Jawn’s, but the idea is
sound.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” agreed Mrs. Wells. “Michaelmas
daisies are decent enough, like some of these black boys,
when they know their proper places.”</p>

<p>The black boys “hyah-hyahed” at this tribute to
their ambitious proclivities. “Saul there,” she went
on, “is a black Michaelmas daisy”—Saul exploded
with appreciative laughter—“he goes right into my
refrigerator without so much as by-your-leave and helps
himself to the best musk-melons. Some day I’ll have
to take my trowel to him and let you boys wheel him
off to the weed-fire.”</p>

<p>The darkies enjoyed this amiable attack on Saul’s
weakness for musk-melon, but none more than the black
culprit. The Virginia give and take between master
and servant was strangely at home in these northern
hills. Evidently, thought Richard, the transplanting
of a hundred years ago had been done with expert skill;
none of the southern flavour had been lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>“Trowel won’t nebber do, M’s Wells,” cried Saul
between choking guffaws; “reckon you-all’ll hab to
git a pickaxe! Yass’m—sho’ hab to git a pickaxe.”</p>

<p>Interested as Richard was in the plantation setting
and in the glorious richness of the floral display his
heart was not dancing like Wordsworth’s for either
daffodils or black-eyed Susans. The first eager thought
that he might find Jerry alone in the gardens had left
a strong desire to go to her. There was much that he
had to say to that young lady. It had better be done
now. “Do it now” was not his favourite motto; it
smacked too much of commerce; but doing it now
seemed suddenly to acquire appropriateness. With
this idea in mind he turned towards the ladder of stones
and began to mount.</p>

<p>“As we go up the steps and turn to the left,” Mrs.
Wells remarked as she followed, “you’ll come upon
something I very much wish you to admire. Jerry said
I mustn’t guide-book you about, so I’ll say nothing
about what you’ll find; but I’m very proud of my—well,
never mind what.”</p>

<p>She was going with him! Well, he would take a
look and then be off. Of course, the gardens were
wonderful, but they would keep, and——</p>

<p>Suddenly he found himself saying, “Beautiful!”
again, exactly as George Alexander had predicted.
Through a dense mass of shrubbery they had picked
their way until abruptly the hollyhocks broke upon
them, thousands of them! It was like a magnificent
western cornfield, tilted to the sun. Walks of snapdragon
and lupine and hardy pinks wound their way
among the giant flowers. And no particular colour had
been allowed to grow in very large masses; the foxglove
and the larkspur and the gladiolus came back, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
the <i>leitmotiv</i> of a German opera, and all joined in a
monster symphonic design, whose design was not
apparent at all. It was the climax, the <i>finale</i>, of the
piece, the full orchestra wherein the little bowers of
blue and pink and yellow had been solos, unaccompanied
flute and clarionet and French horn.</p>

<p>But even here there were turns of the path, hummocks
of hardy shrubs, unexpected beflowered walls,
and finally, at the top of the hill, in the early stage of
light-green bloom, a veritable grove of hydrangeas.
“<i>Gi</i>-unts, they is, reg-u-lar hydrang’a <i>gi</i>-unts!” George
Alexander had called them. Through the myriad
straight slender trunks the blue sky beyond the hill
formed a perfect background; and with the massive
clustered heads, seemingly clipped out into symmetrical
designs, the scene had all the effect of a gigantic
Maxfield Parrish poster.</p>

<p>For the first time Richard neglected to say “Beautiful!”
Instead, he looked on in thoughtful wonder,
turned about and took in the sweep of acres below him
crowded with perennials, masses of deep red and old
rose and white which he had not seen before. Then he
began to understand the enormous effort of the thing,
and the cost in money, time and labour. So he did not
say “Beautiful,” but he thought of George Alexander
and said to himself, “Grapes fust!”</p>

<p>But he did not follow George Alexander’s directions
and say it aloud. The beauty of the scene before him
was too rare an experience; and grapes, after all, were
simply something for sale. It was not expected that
George Alexander’s mind could get above the rise and
fall of the market. Beauty was an emotional experience,
not something to be sold for a penny; and
emotional experiences were the essence of living. Better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
a dinner of herbs where beauty is than many profitable
baskets of grapes.</p>

<p>So he turned to the expectant woman beside him and
praised and praised. These gardens were a revelation
of her mind, he told her, a cross-section of her soul.
Unconsciously he began to batter down George Alexander’s
arguments against thrift and close buying and
selling and all the other despicable acts of trade.</p>

<p>The penniless are the most eloquent abusers of
wealth! What is money, he asked her derisively,
compared with the wealth before them! “Let the
millioned-dollared ride! Barefoot trudging at his side”
hath what wealth cannot purchase. Thrift? Economy?
Profit? He repudiated them all and apostrophized
the work before him, and crowned with rhetoric
the Workwoman.</p>

<p>The Workwoman glowed and applauded; and for
payment she let him into the secrets of her craft; her
fight against mullein and sorrel, grubs, and cut-worms;
the mysteries of mulch; the struggle to keep a steady
Christian colour in sweet-williams, hollyhocks and
columbines; the everlasting effort to lift the cup of
cold water to the lips of the ever-thirsty gladiolus; the
war against the onrush of Michaelmas daisy, Bouncing
Bet and hawkbit; the constant necessity of nipping
helianthus, phlox and golden glow, which otherwise
grow rank and ungainly; the multifarious uses of sprays
for killing everything from larkspur blight to rose-bugs.
And she confessed her private theories of soils and her
views on seed propagation and root splitting; on
fertilizers; on cold frames; and on continuous bloom
throughout the year.</p>

<p>“Helen Albee tells me that no one can get a continuous
blue,” she warmed up enthusiastically, “but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
did it one year.” And then she started a technical
avalanche of names. “Who is Helen Albee? She
is a fellow-conspirator among us hardy perennialists.
I give her credit for all this—she and Lena Walker—I
was nowhere until I met those two.”</p>

<p>There was no false egotism about this artist.
Richard was astonished at the change in her. Her old
self had almost come back, and something moved him
to tell her so. They had been sitting for some time in
the shadow of the hydrangeas and were facing out
towards the Lake.</p>

<p>“No;” she closed her lips firmly; “I am not myself
yet.... I am not well. Ever since——”</p>

<p>Abruptly she stopped speaking and with caution
pressed a hand to her heart, almost furtively. It was
there that Walter had struck her, but she would not
have admitted it. The blow had been something more
than mental; it had left a physical bruise which
declined to heal; and she was conscious of occasional
inward pain which she tried to tell herself would soon
pass away. But Richard, who saw the quiver pass over
her face, did not observe the motion of her hand, and
he could not have suspected its cause. And even if he
had guessed, this weak old woman would have straightened
up valiantly and would have lied about it with
deceiving outward cheerfulness. The Virginia plantation
of the early nineteenth century had been moved
north with all its characteristic virtues intact!</p>

<p>But she had begun to confess once more to this
dutiful squire. “No; I am not well,” she said.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” Richard said feelingly.</p>

<p>“I know you are,” she nodded her head several
times thoughtfully; “I feel your sincerity. That’s why
I tell you so much that I conceal from others. Let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
tell you some more.... You are as good as a priest,”
she smiled at him. “It is only in my gardens that I
feel my old self. I am not strong any more—no! you
need not try to encourage me; I know. But up here
among my flowers I fool myself—I act as if I were in
control of things; I boss the black boys about and boss
even the flowers and the rose-bugs. I’m happy up here;
I have nothing to worry me.”</p>

<p>She stopped, evidently at the preamble of her confession.
Walter was on Richard’s mind, and on that
score he was preparing himself to infuse self-confidence
into her; but her mind was leagues from Walter.</p>

<p>Richard laughed to dispel the effect of her gloomy
tone and asked what on earth she had to worry about.</p>

<p>“‘Red Jacket’ is mortgaged to the limit, and the
interest is long overdue; I have been borrowing for
twenty years, and I don’t know how many thousands
I owe,” she remarked simply, as casually as if she had
invited him to enjoy the view.</p>

<p>The unexpected information shocked him, although
certainly George Alexander had given him ample clues.
He began a speech about the uselessness of money—one
of his favourite poetic theories—but it did not ring
true. For the first time in his life he found that
Thoreauean point of view distasteful.</p>

<p>“Does Jerry know?” he interrupted himself.</p>

<p>“She’ll know if she can ever make head or tail out of
the books,” she answered serenely. “Well!” she gave
a tremendous sigh of relief and actually smiled. “I’m
glad I don’t have to do the juggling any longer. I’ve
thrown it all on Jerry now. She’s young and able, I
guess. She’ll find a way out, never fear.”</p>

<p>And so she talked complacently, meanwhile with
every other sentence giving ugly details which showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
plainly enough, even to Richard’s non-commercial
experience, that Jerry would have to be a financial
magician to find any way out except via bankruptcy.
He tried to quiz her, but she put him off with the plea
that the business of managing the estate was no longer
her affair. She was too happy with her perennials to
spoil it all with figures that would not come out right.
She joked about it, too; showing all too clearly that if
bossing things in the gardens had given her the appearance
of her old masterful self, it was an appearance
only. A bit of her mind, seemingly, had become
atrophied without in the least harming the remainder.
Heretofore she had been both a dominating manager of
a complicated estate and a clever gardener; at present
the dominating manager had vanished, leaving only the
clever gardener.</p>

<p>Richard rose precipitately. He must see Jerry at
once. She had seemed particularly worried lately;
and he remembered with a pang that he and Jawn had
been trying to joke her into good spirits. With this
calamity hanging over her—already she must have got
an inkling of the state of affairs—they had been
unforgivably cruel. He must go to her instantly.</p>

<p>“Who is your lawyer?” he asked Mrs. Wells; his
tone was almost crisp.</p>

<p>“My lawyer?” she inquired in turn. “I never had
any.”</p>

<p>“You speak of mortgages and bonds and transfers
of property,” he followed up quickly. “Whom do you
consult about such matters?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she smiled sweetly; “you mean Mitchell
Lear, I suppose. Of course, he’s a lawyer; but I never
go to him about law matters—only as a friend.”</p>

<p>“Does he know about your affairs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>She thought carefully. “Ye-es,” she admitted.
“He knows; not that I ever told him much, but he
always guessed, I reckon. I fibbed to him about everything,”
she laughed at the remembrance, “but you can’t
fool Mitchell Lear. Words aren’t anything to him;
he just looks on quietly through your eyes and into the
very privacy of your soul. Once I told him a long
story about deciding to buy more orchard land—buy,
you understand—and after I was quite done, he nodded
his wise head and remarked, ‘I’m sorry you’ve made
up your mind to sell!’ ‘But I said “buy,”’ said I.
‘I heard you,’ said he; ‘and I say that you are making
a mistake to sell.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells laughed quietly and contentedly at the
remembrance. “And the funny part of it was,” she
told Richard, “I had just sold all the orchard we possessed;
and it <i>was</i> a mistake, too,” she added, “just as
he knew it would be.... Oh, well! I mustn’t think of
those things any more; they make me too unhappy.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells was sorry to see Richard go—there were
many more things to show him, but he would have none
of them. With a faintly troubled face she watched
him stride down a path and disappear behind a grove
of hollyhocks. But in a moment or two she had forgotten
about him and was calling her blacks about her.
The imperative duty of the hour was rose-bugs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>SETH’S WHIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard’s</span> best singing of the “Hel-lo” call failed
to bring a response from Jerry.</p>

<p>“Mrs.” George Alexander, who, as “Sukie,” presided
over the kitchen, reckoned that Miss Geraldine had
gone down to visit Mrs. Phœbe Norris. That’s what
she “reckoned,” but she “’lowed” that Miss Geraldine
might go even farther. One of the Wheelen boys was
with her.</p>

<p>“When one o’ dem Wheelen boys comes ’long,”
Sukie explained, “nobody c’d tell <i>whar</i> M’s Geraldine
’ud lan’ up. Ef she jes’ tuck it in her head to go plum
down dat Lake to Hammonspo’t, plum down dat Lake
she’d go! When M’s Geraldine gits in dem canoes she
jes’ na’chully do’ know when to git outen ’em!”</p>

<p>Off on a canoe trip! That did not sound like bankruptcy;
although it corresponded surprisingly to the
mother’s free and easy Southern manner of handling
high finance.</p>

<p>But perhaps Sukie’s “reckoning” was more nearly
correct than her “’lowing.” He would investigate
further at the Norris cottage.</p>

<p>“Too late, young man,” cried Phœbe before he could
state his errand. “Anyone could see by the rush you
made down that hill and by the glitter in your eye that
you are tryin’ to overtake a woman. Jerry is gone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
The other man has her, and my tip is that you had
better bring matters to a point quickly—or you’ll lose
nest and feathers too.”</p>

<p>His rapid-fire questions exhibited Phœbe in the light
of a perfect mind-reader. But she had no help for him.
They had gone off in Wheelen’s canoe; there was no
telling when they would be back.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait,” said Richard firmly, and sat down upon
one of her comfortable porch chairs.</p>

<p>“I’m thinkin’ of putting up a sign,” remarked
Phœbe. Richard gazed down the Lake and made no
answer. “Only I’m not sure whether to make it
‘Beware the dog,’ or ‘Trespassing forbidden.’...
Perhaps I’ll make it ‘Huntin’ not allowed on this land’—meanin’
by that, ‘girl huntin’’—or mebbe I’ll just
have it read, ‘The Norris Inn; Meals Furnished Free.’”</p>

<p>“Eh?” he came out of his fixed stare. “Did you
say something about eating? I’m really quite hungry.”</p>

<p>“Of course you would be!” she said. “Feed a stray
dog an’ he’ll always come back. It was a mistake ever
to give you two anything. Your friend Jawn was here
for two-o’clock tea. What’ll you have, sir?” She
flung a bit of sewing over her left arm and impersonated
an ingratiating waiter. “We recommend our toasted
muffins and tea.”</p>

<p>“Great!” he agreed politely. “I’d be delighted.”</p>

<p>But anyone could see that his mind was not on food.
Down the Lake he squinted with wrinkling brows as if
he were trying to read the name on a far-distant
steamer.</p>

<p>“As a rule canoes don’t travel in the middle of the
Lake,” said Phœbe.</p>

<p>“Eh?” he looked up absently.</p>

<p>“They hug the shore,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>“Oh! Do they?... Why?”</p>

<p>“Canoeing is said to be a dangerous sport.”
Phœbe talked through the window as she prepared the
muffins. “And it is. Although, for myself, I’m
thinkin’ there’s less danger out in the middle of the
Lake where everybody can see you with field-glasses than
goin’ in and out among the bushes and gettin’ out ever
so often to sit down under a tree and rest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get that,” said Richard.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t,” commented Phœbe dryly. “I
believe I once called you a clever rascal. I apologize
and withdraw the ‘clever.’ You are not clever.”</p>

<p>“Very good! Very good!” With an effort Richard
had caught the point of her satire and applauded
politely. But his mind was elsewhere, as evidenced
by his sudden remark, “You told me the Wells’ were
prosperous.”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“No. They’re in bad straits financially. Perhaps
you have known; at any rate my instinct tells me
that it will do no harm to tell you.”</p>

<p>Phœbe left her muffins toasting and came out to him.</p>

<p>“Who’s been puttin’ that into your head?” she
inquired seriously.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Wells.”</p>

<p>For a moment Phœbe stared at him soberly; then
she broke into merriment.</p>

<p>“It’s no joke,” he said solemnly. “She has sold
off the land that paid the best income—the apples—and
she has been borrowing and not paying back for
twenty years.”</p>

<p>Phœbe sat down weakly.</p>

<p>“You’re tryin’ to frighten me,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s the truth. Furthermore——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>Richard ceased speaking and fumbled for cigarette
paper.</p>

<p>“Furthermore what?” Phœbe demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>“Your muffins are burning.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em! What’s this furthermore business?”</p>

<p>“I’m very sensitive to odours.”</p>

<p>“And I’m very sensitive to furthermores. Furthermore
what?”</p>

<p>Richard puffed slowly.</p>

<p>“Well, it is only a fear I have that Mrs. Wells may
have used money that was not, strictly speaking, her
own.”</p>

<p>“<i>Take that back!</i>”</p>

<p>Phœbe jumped to her feet, reached up deftly and
unhooked the stout whip that had done duty for some
years as a protector from Seth. “Take it back, I
say!” she cried as she swung the lash, “or I’ll make
you take it back.”</p>

<p>She was trembling with anger, and she looked
murderous.</p>

<p>“All right,” Richard puffed away quietly. “I’ll
take it back, although I think you should attend to
those muffins before you cart-whip me. I’d rather have
my muffins in the mouth than in the nose, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>Phœbe struggled a moment with her quivering anger
and then put back her whip and strode to the rescue of
the muffins.</p>

<p>Nearly a half-hour slipped away before she returned.
Richard was only a desultory smoker, but he had time
to roll a number of cigarettes before she appeared
finally with a tray of fresh muffins, some jam and
a pot of hot tea. All trace of her anger was gone, too.</p>

<p>“There is only one thing I hate worse than a lie,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
she began the conversation as she poured the tea, “and
that is the truth.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right,” he agreed as he spread a hot
muffin. “Truth is the nastiest dose in the pharmacopœia.
Perhaps I came at you too strong, but I think I
made no mistake in thinking you can stand a lot. I
have always been frank with you, Phœbe, and my
instinct tells me——”</p>

<p>“Your instinct had better be careful,” she warned,
flushing a little; “it nearly got you a welt across
the face.”</p>

<p>“And I am very glad,” he replied calmly. “If you
would flame up like that for your friends you would do
a lot more to help them out of their troubles. I fear
they’ll need all the help you can give them.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better tell me what you know.
You take your own risk, of course”—she was regaining
her normal cheerfulness—“if I don’t like
what you know, you may get this pot of hot tea in
your face.... Go on; I’m listenin’—carefully.”</p>

<p>He related the confession which Mrs. Wells had made
to him under the hydrangeas, but for prudential reasons
he did not divulge the ground of his belief that some of
Mrs. Wells’ business transactions may not have been
entirely business-like.</p>

<p>To Richard’s surprise, Phœbe broke into nervous
laughter.</p>

<p>“What a fool I’ve been,” said she, “ever to get
stirred up by all that! Can’t you see that the old
lady was just tryin’ you out?”</p>

<p>“No; I don’t see anything of the sort.”</p>

<p>“You believe all she said?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I asked you first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“Yes; I do believe it. If they were sold out
to-morrow, the debts would overwhelm them.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose the jig’s up?”</p>

<p>Phœbe was still intent on her moving-picture film of
a pair of New York villains attempting to marry
money; but Richard understood her differently.</p>

<p>“I fear the jig is up, as you say. Of course,” he
added, “I’ll have to see Jerry first to make sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Phœbe, “you had better make sure.
But I’m sorry for one thing——”</p>

<p>“Which is?”</p>

<p>“That I didn’t give you that welt with the whip.”</p>

<p>He laughed, not at all taking her seriously.</p>

<p>“But you may get it yet,” she laughed in turn....
“<i>Walter told me your other name!</i>” She shot the
information at him suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he remarked casually; “he did, did he?”</p>

<p>“Rather a sporty name to be gallivantin’ under,
eh?”</p>

<p>“I never liked it.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“It made me too conspicuous.... And people
asked such impertinent questions.”</p>

<p>“They would!”</p>

<p>“Yes; Richard Richard is much better.... Don’t
tell Jerry about the other name yet, will you?”</p>

<p>She agreed. Somehow she felt sorry for the man.
According to her theory he had played for high stakes
and lost. About that she cared little. But his coolness
and good nature pleased her; and he had courage,
for he had never so much as flinched when she flung the
big whip. No doubt he would have taken her blow
without even lifting his guard. He had merely looked
up at her with his mild blue eye, scrutinizing her with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
an almost disinterested curiosity. Seth had always
dropped on all fours at the very sight of the whip;
this man was built on a more courageous mould, and
she admired him immensely for it.</p>

<p>“You’re a good sport,” she summed him up, “even
if you are a bad lot.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.... Where is Walter?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He and Jawn are sailing the new boat.” She
laughed at some memory of their setting forth. That
laugh was a brave attempt to conceal her worry over
the Wells’ affairs. “Jawn’s a bright lad, he is; but
he—he ought to have the whip, too.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” Richard assented. “Was he nice
and vulgar to you to-day? Jawn loves to be vulgar.”</p>

<p>“I’m no judge of such things,” she parried; “it
takes all my time just to enjoy them.”</p>

<p>“Young woman,” he told her in his smiling superior
way, “that’s a mighty fine formula to go through life
on. Why be always judging and valuing? One needs
all the time just to enjoy.”</p>

<p>Silence fell between them. Hovering over the pleasant
tea-table was the memory of the recent ugly scene and
beyond that the fate of the Wells family.</p>

<p>“I believe you would!” Phœbe remarked in answer
to one of her own thoughts.</p>

<p>“Perhaps.” He sipped his tea contentedly, looked
down the Lake and waited.</p>

<p>“If the Big House should go to smash,” she explained
finally, “I believe you would loaf about enjoyin’ yourself
with what was left in the refrigerator and then
tramp off without caring a——”</p>

<p>She left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>“Say it,” he suggested. “‘Damn’ is no longer a
bad word. It has been taken up by the best people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>“I believe you would!” she iterated.</p>

<p>“I would enjoy myself,” he agreed; “and quite
possibly I would tap the refrigerator, if it were hungry
time; and even more possibly I would loaf; and maybe
I would tramp off. Ye-es,” he figured the matter over
carefully, “I am sure I should enjoy it, too—immensely.
Do you know, I am rather hoping the Big
House will go to smash—although it’s a point of view
I never suspected I should hold. In fact, I’m getting
more delight out of the thought every minute....
My whole life is turning right over like a turtle that
has been on his back for thirty years.... You can’t
imagine how excited I am.”</p>

<p>“No,” she snapped; “praise be, I can’t. I’m—I’m——”
a wave of emotion swept her—“dang it all,
man, how can you sit there and grin with all this
happenin’ to Jerry!”</p>

<p>“All what?” he asked with a fine affectation of
innocence.</p>

<p>“All what!” she exploded. “They’ve lived in the
Big House ever since there was a Big House, and even
before that in the log-cabins where the negroes are now.
Of course I’ve always known something like this would
happen——”</p>

<p>“Ah! ha!” said the man, “you knew it, did
you?”</p>

<p>“I have ears, man!” she snapped. “I hear without
listenin’ at keyholes. Everybody in Jerusalem township
knows the Big House is mortgaged, but mortgages are
respectable enough. We always thought she preferred
to invest her money in better paying stocks and
things.... What has she done with it all? That’s
what I should like to know.”</p>

<p>“She has over thirty negroes on the pay-roll,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
suggested without much concern, although he did not
miss Phœbe’s agitation. “That should mean at least
five thousand a year in wages; and from what I know
of the Wells’ bounty, those negroes and their families
get practically everything they need free. The gardens
cost a couple of thousand a year. The accumulation
of small wastage would amount to considerable; and
then, you know, the income has been impaired mightily
through the sale of the orchards, and the failure to
get the most out of the grapes. They’ve been spending
more than they earned—considerably more, I should
judge—and they have tried the old expedient of making
up the deficit each year by borrowing.”</p>

<p>He said not a word about the possible breach of trust
as to the negroes. Phœbe would have given much to
be able to ask him; but, somehow, she could not get
the question out. She feared the truth.</p>

<p>“They’re about at the end of their rope,” he went on.
“The fiddler will have to be paid, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“That’s <i>all</i>!” she echoed indignantly. “Isn’t it
enough? The money’s nothin’ and the food’s nothin’,”
she went on excitedly. “I have plenty to keep both
families alive and free from the necessity of doing a
stroke the rest of their lives. It isn’t that, man. The
Wells family have been used to living on a big scale.
They have been surrounded by negroes who fetch and
carry for them, and they have been the ‘big family’ in
this part of the country for a century or more. They
could never come down. Don’t you see it, man? It
would kill them. They could never pig it along the
way you and I could do. Don’t sit there and grin at
me, you blitherin’ fool! What I want to know is what
we’re goin’ to do about it?”</p>

<p>He puffed away deliberately and watched her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
animated face as if he enjoyed her dramatics. Then
he said:</p>

<p>“We’re going to pay off the debts, liquidate the
mortgage and set the Wells family on its feet—bail
’em out, in short.”</p>

<p>“We are, are we?” she tossed her head. “And
with what?”</p>

<p>“Money.”</p>

<p>“Whose money? I’ve got none; at least none that
would count.”</p>

<p>“My money.”</p>

<p>“Talk sense, man,” she stood up and sat down
nervously. “It’ll take thousands to——”</p>

<p>“Easily that,” he figured. “I’m counting on about
sixty thousand. The place is mortgaged for forty-two
thousand dollars, thirty thousand on a first mortgage
and twelve thousand on a second. She has notes out
amounting to about eight thousand more. That’s fifty
thousand. She owes the negroes about ten thousand
more——”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Phœbe, “the negroes. Where’d
they get ten thou——”</p>

<p>She stopped, aghast at the thought that had crossed
her mind. She knew all about the Wells’ scheme of
keeping back half of the wages into a savings fund; and
she knew that it was something more than a charity.
A contract guaranteeing those savings had been drawn
up for each employee on the Wells estate. Such money
belonged to the negroes, and Mrs. Wells was nothing
more than a legal trustee of the funds. If that
had been touched, Phœbe with her natural business
experience knew that something more than the mild
procedure of bankruptcy might be in store for Jerry’s
mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“Did she say she had used that money, too?”
Phœbe asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>“I fear so,” he told her kindly. “But don’t worry,
my dear girl. As soon as I have talked with Jerry—I
want to see those documents—I’ll get in touch with
New York and fix the whole business up.”</p>

<p>“You’re not foolin’ me, are you?” she asked
plaintively.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I thought you had no money.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t until a few hours ago.”</p>

<p>“How much have you got?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Phœbe,” he laughed excitedly like a
boy. “Heaps of it. Barrels of it. Millions, I think.”</p>

<p>“If I find you’re jokin’ with me, young man, I’ll—I’ll——”</p>

<p>Tears dropped from her eyes. She dashed them off
with her hand in order the better to glare at him.</p>

<p>“Didn’t Walter tell you who I am?” he asked
soothingly.</p>

<p>“But you’re not that man.” She stamped her foot.
“He died years ago—in a yacht—I read about it.”</p>

<p>“That was my father; we had the same name.”</p>

<p>With a word here and there he managed to calm her
agitation. Slowly she became convinced that this easy-going
young man was a financial aristocrat, a wizard
come in time to save her friends.</p>

<p>He had been a sickly boy, he told her; so the family
had let him grow up a recluse. It was not until he
had arrived at college years that he began to develop
physically, but by that time, although he had grown
into a stalwart frame of a man, he was hopelessly bookish
and “queer.” The father was one of the dominant
big men of his time, but he was kind and sympathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
with the boy, so “Richard” had gone his own way and
was allowed peacefully to ply his individualism.</p>

<p>“After college,” he told her, “I decided that I could
not live the dependent life any longer. I talked it over
with father and he told me to try things out for myself.
He offered me money, but that did not seem like playing
fair; so I told him that I’d feel much happier if I
went it ‘on my own,’ as the English say. He said it
wouldn’t be a bad idea to knock about a bit and discover
what I was best fitted to do. And so I drifted
here and there, sometimes having things easy and sometimes
not so easy, but you can’t imagine how contented
I was. I have an enormous curiosity about life—I’m
perfectly greedy to know why things are the way they
are.... Then I fell in with Jawn’s group over on the
West Side and met the ‘Widow’ Knowles, who gives me
enough tutoring to do to keep me in food and raiment,
and I lived—well, like the lilies of the field.”</p>

<p>“But is it true that your father was——” But she
found she could not say it; it seemed too heartless to
ask him.</p>

<p>“Quite true,” he answered her unfinished question.</p>

<p>“It’s a brute I am to ask you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all,” he replied pleasantly. “Death is
lying in wait for all of us.... The thing preyed on
my mind for many months, but it taught me much in
the end.... I think now I shall face my own death
all the better.”</p>

<p>“Please!” she covered her eyes. “Don’t talk about
it. Death is horrible.”</p>

<p>“Death is only the end of the great adventure,” he
assured her; “and perhaps—who knows—the beginning
of a more glorious one. I have a keen sense of
the shortness of life, but that does not horrify me; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
makes me all the more appreciative of each hour of it,
and it makes me kinder to all men. That’s why I
refuse to make a frantic struggle out of it.”</p>

<p>Richard’s calm was very consoling to Phœbe; unconsciously
she partook of it and lost some of her
dolefulness. For several minutes their talk lapsed.
Finally he asked, “Do I look scared?”</p>

<p>“What are you scared of? It’s me that ought to
be scared; and I am—scared that it’s a big lie you’re
tellin’ me. Millions! Huh! It’s a hard dose to
swallow.”</p>

<p>“Just the same I’m frightened. It’ll mean work——”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Phœbe exulted. “So it’s work you’re scared
at. There’s a man for you!”</p>

<p>“It will mean work,” he went on soberly, “and
slavery.”</p>

<p>“Go ’long with you, man! Slavery? It’ll be the
chauffeurs and the butler and the cooks and the landscape
gardeners who’ll be the slaves. What’ll you need
to slave at?”</p>

<p>“It will mean giving up this blessed freedom. All
my life I have fled from responsibilities and burdens;
now I am going straight out to seek them. Others
will depend upon me. If I make mistakes, I’ll suffer
because others will suffer. That’s why I’m scared.
I’m like the soldier in an ugly bayonet fight; it’s a
sickening job, but it’s his job and he must do it. I
hope I’m not a coward——”</p>

<p>“Faith,” chirped the practical Phœbe, “you can
afford to be anything if you’ve got money.”</p>

<p>“I remember my father”—something in his tone
stopped her raillery.</p>

<p>“Tell me about your father,” she interrupted
quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“He was a very sensitive man, and the world was very
hard upon him. They called him a money-grabber.
The cartoonist pictured him with an eternal dollar-mark
on his forehead. Any comedian could raise a
laugh by merely mentioning his name. Even in serious
plays they made fun of him. Yet he never worked for
himself. During the big panics he hardly slept. We
have a private letter from a president of the United
States, written in his own hand, praising father for his
work in stopping a national disaster, yet that very
president begged him not to disclose the fact that he
had written. It would be misunderstood, he wrote; it
would damage the government if the people knew....
My father treasured that letter, although it hurt him.
But he never complained. He gave even more of his
hours to the service of others.... I have seen the
brooding anxiety in his eyes.... When he was ill he
dare not let it be known—the market would feel it.
He could not take holidays like other folks; he could
not even be friendly; and he hungered for public
appreciation.</p>

<p>“The world tore at his character during muck-raking
days, and even struck at his family. Cameras snapped
at us wherever we went. I used to hate to look at a
newspaper. The boys in school jibed me until I grew
positively mute. I think they were envious—some
of them—of my public fame. Envy! Merciful
heavens!... Father asked only to be let alone, and
they gave him ugly notoriety. Even his tragic death
was made the subject of horrible jokes.... And I
am going to take up the work.... I’m scared, but
only because I feel that I may not be worthy.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you do it for?” asked Phœbe.
“Come up on the Lake and let the world go to pot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
What they say about you in the columns of the
<i>Express</i> or the <i>Chronicle</i> won’t keep you awake o’
nights. Why do you mux your life up with finance
and all that if you don’t like it? I believe you do
like it.”</p>

<p>Some of the brooding anxiety of his father had come
into his eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” he spoke thoughtfully, “I think I never shall
like it. But I must go forward just the same.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>For a moment he did not answer. He seemed not to
have heard her question. Finally he spoke.</p>

<p>“Some persons would call it Duty. That isn’t what
I call it. But I know exactly what it is. It is a force
in you that will not be diverted. It points you to your
job, whether it be loafing or playing or sweating labour.
You may cry out against it, but you go on just the
same. It keeps men—and women too—at the grubbiest
of tasks. Without it civilization would not be....
My job is clear. I thought I never would do it,
but now I know that I shall; and I know, too, that I
always intended to. My wander-years were all preparing
me for this—and I never suspected it until now.
I have been standing aloof and watching life pass by,
and now I am tumbled into the torrent.... It is part
of the great plan.... But,” he added wistfully, “the
watching days were good—and they were necessary.”</p>

<p>A chirp or two came into Phœbe’s voice, but the
brooding sense of disaster still lingered. Finally she
said, “But I don’t see how you can help them,” meaning
Mrs. Wells and Jerry.</p>

<p>“Father left his affairs in the hands of a trusted
group of his friends,” he explained. “They are to
carry on the estate until such time as I shall make up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
my mind to take charge.... I thought that time was
postponed for ever. Now,” he stood up and cried
exultantly, “now I’m eager for it!”</p>

<p>“And so you’re not a villain after all.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, Phœbe.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” She began to assert her old self.
“Then Jawn is.”</p>

<p>“Wrong again.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she shook her head. “I’ll watch him
just the same. And I’ll keep an eye on you, too,
sonny. It’s a nice story you’ve been tellin’ me. Mebbe
it’s all true; but, I warn you, the moment either of you
tries to sell me stock in rubber trees in Madagascar, I’ll
put the whip to you.”</p>

<p>To help him out she told him of the meek gentleman
who tried to hoodwink the village.</p>

<p>“I may own stock in that concern for all I know,” he
laughed. “Would you believe it, child, I’m crazy to
find out what I do own!... But, remember, Jerry
must know nothing until I tell her myself. Promise
me you won’t let the cat out of the bag.”</p>

<p>“Tell her?” quoth she. “Is it garrulous as well
as stupid you think I am? If Jerry knew the truth
about you she’d die rather than accept a penny.”</p>

<p>“Really?” He was genuinely concerned.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a hard job before you, young man!”
She enjoyed his discomfiture. “I don’t know which is
the harder, to get sixty thousand dollars out of ‘Red
Jacket’ or to get sixty thousand into it. The Wells’
would rather go to the poorhouse than take an unearned
penny from anybody. Tell her? You don’t suppose
I want to commit financial suicide, do you? Pfist!”
She raised a warning finger. “They’re comin’ round
the bend; they’re almost on us. I wish you luck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
‘Mr. Richard,’” she chuckled, “and, faith, you’ll
need it.”</p>

<p>Around the bend they came, Jerry at the prow of a
long birch canoe, the Wheelen boy at the stern. Slowly
and silently she swung the slender paddle as Seneca
maidens had done on those waters for hundreds of
years; and with her brown conventional bathing suit
and her braided brown hair she looked the part of
aboriginal.</p>

<p>“Hel-lo!” he sang.</p>

<p>“Hel-lo!” came back across the water. There was
not a sign of weakness or fear in the long-drawn “lo!”
Evidently she was still ignorant of the meaning of all
those cryptic entries in her mother’s books.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>POET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> a dozen yards of the shore Jerry stopped
paddling and held up her right hand, two fingers
extended like a papal benediction. Anyone brought
up in the country knows that silent code. It suggests
willows and spring-boards and “sandy bottoms”; and
translated into the vernacular it means, “Let’s go
swimmin’!”</p>

<p>But Richard Richard had never had a boyhood.
Perhaps one of the things that made him so eager to
look the world in the face was the fact that nurses and
governesses and private tutors had been his portion,
and what summers his sickly life had permitted were
spent with other sheltered youth in the south of France
or in the Swiss Alps.</p>

<p>“Are you giving me a Tshoti-non-da-waga blessing?”
he asked when she stepped on the shore.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know the sign?” she asked incredulously.</p>

<p>“No; what does it mean?”</p>

<p>“Really?” She stood before him looking at him
curiously. “Where have you been brung up! It
means, ‘Let’s go swimmin’.’ Every country boy knows
that.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had been a country boy.” He spoke with
a touch of regret.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me you spent your summers in New York
City.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“Even that would have been something,” said he
ruefully. “Those kids over on the West Side have lots
of fun.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she smiled, “if you were neither a country
boy nor a city boy, what were you?”</p>

<p>Phœbe joined them. The Wheelen boy had made
his farewells and had piloted his canoe around the bend.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” said Phœbe. “He was sent up to
the Reform School at an early age and then transferred
to Matteawan. He’s just out of the crazy house. I
know; I’m an expert. Besides, he’s just been tellin’ me
all about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s just about the size of it,” Richard admitted.
“I was be-governessed and be-tutored all my young
days. I was a frail lad, you know. You wouldn’t
believe it to see me now. I’m like Theodore Roosevelt
in that respect. You know he was a discard in his
young days, but he built himself into the prize-fighter
class. That’s what they did with me.... I got so
used to being out of things which other boys were
doing that, somehow, I didn’t miss them. I was almost
seventeen before I began to put on weight.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you ever go swimming and orchard robbing
and nutting with the ‘gang’?” Jerry asked.</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“You poor boy!”</p>

<p>“Poor!” ejaculated Phœbe, then slapped a hand
over her mouth and retreated into the house. “How
ever am I going to keep my mouth shut?” she asked
herself. “The only thing for me to do is to go out
and dig garden until they go away.”</p>

<p>The signal to go swimming was given again.</p>

<p>“Sure!” Richard assented with alacrity. “What’s
the way to answer that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“Two fingers of the left hand for ‘All right,’ and
one finger for ‘Can’t.’”</p>

<p>He waved his two fingers and darted into the
house.</p>

<p>When he came out he found her in the water at the
head of the dock. Certainly as she moved about with
exquisite grace in the transparent water she looked like
some lithe aquatic animal.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to be watched,” she spoke quietly.
“Come in.”</p>

<p>He understood, and plunged immediately.</p>

<p>“That brown costume matches you so well,” he
explained, “you looked like a sleek otter, or like young
Mowgli out of the <i>Jungle Book</i>, only you don’t kick
your legs like a frog.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.” They were moving very, very
leisurely out into the Lake. “You would soon tire
with that frog kick.”</p>

<p>The day he had looked out of the window in Phœbe’s
house and had seen her swim by he had noticed—Keuka
water is as clear as an aquarium—that she “walked”
as she swam, one leg drawn after the other, the sign of
the long-distance swimmer.</p>

<p>“Where shall we go?” he asked after a few moments
of silent swimming. “I like to have something to
aim at.”</p>

<p>“Let’s cross.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“That bushy clump of trees which come down to the
water’s edge; straight ahead now.”</p>

<p>“I see them.”</p>

<p>It was a diagonal cut, probably a mile and a half
across, but the water was delicious, and they were in no
haste. At times they spoke a sentence or two, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
the most part they moved on rhythmically without a
word. Each seemed to know instinctively when to
stop and “tread” or when to float and rest. It was
the essence of tranquillity which speech would have
spoiled.</p>

<p>Several times they faced each other for long, steady
minutes. He could observe the easy swing of the arm,
the coiled brown hair, the wet eyelashes and the silk
insignia of the French swimming club on the edge of
her garment; and she could note his natural ease in
the water, but particularly his face of many lines. She
would have liked to examine it furrow by furrow, but
his scrutinizing blue eye kept too watchful a guard.
And she was not quite certain if he had not begun to
“make eyes at her”; so she would turn away and use a
stroke that left him to study the coil on coil of braided
hair. And then, safely turned away, she would permit
her face to smile in quiet enjoyment of the catastrophe
that would occur—panic, indeed!—if he could know
what racing thoughts were hers!</p>

<p>And all the while he was thinking of the phenomena
of communication: how each mind was busy on its own
affairs with only a yard or two of space between, yet
neither able to enter the privacy of the other. He
conjectured that the documents which Mrs. Wells had
given her to study had not yet told their story of
disaster. Or else she was an incredible actor. And
while he planned carefully how to settle the difficulties
of the estate without giving her pride a chance to
object, he was thankful for the miracle that separated
their minds so absolutely.</p>

<p>He was thankful for other reasons. While he
watched her face he wondered why she had told Walter
that Richard and she had “fixed it up.” Walter had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
been explicit; he insisted that Jerry had owned that
she and Richard were agreed on marriage. Walter
may have been mistaken, but Richard could not shake
off the air of probability about Walter’s assertion. If
she had made such a statement—nothing in the calm
face beside him remotely suggested such a thing—there
was some good reason back of it. So much he assured
himself, but, puzzle as he could, he found no satisfying
explanation.</p>

<p>The swim was not fatiguing because they were experienced
swimmers and knew how to make journeys of
that sort; but, nevertheless, on reaching the other side,
they lay down on the grass and took the precaution of
a good rest.</p>

<p>“How goes the bookkeeping, Lady Manager?” he
asked.</p>

<p>She did not reply at first.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she admitted at length. “But I fear
I have not been putting my mind to it the way I
should.”</p>

<p>“Let me help.”</p>

<p>She thought about that for several seconds before
replying.</p>

<p>“I am not sure whether I want you to know,” she
spoke finally. “There are more entries about mortgages
and notes than I care to expose.... Mother
seems to have been borrowing like sixty for a great
many years, and I haven’t been able to discover yet
what she has done with the proceeds.... I am beginning
to fear that we are not so well off as I always
believed.”</p>

<p>“Would you care much?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she reflected. “I’ve never had to
think about money matters. It’s like gravity or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
weight of the atmosphere; I don’t suppose we’d miss
either unless they should suddenly leave us.... That
swim was mighty close to it, though; wasn’t it?” She
had shifted the subject adroitly.</p>

<p>“Great!” he lolled at length. “It’s a species of
gravity-less universe we were floating in.... Great!”</p>

<p>She had not discovered the state of affairs yet, he
thought, although she was “getting warm.” So both
were willing to drop the subject, but neither was
inclined to bring up another. A minute or two slipped
by, then five minutes, then twenty-five. Crickets droned
lazily; near by a catbird called, and far off a pack of
noisy crows quarrelled and fluttered about the top of a
dead tree.</p>

<p>Speech would have kept these two young persons
politely apart, but the silence was quivering with
intimacies. And so, when Jerry sat up and raised two
fingers mischievously, he flashed back the response and
walked with her to the water without the necessity of
a disturbing word.</p>

<p>Not until they reached the home shore did they
speak. Then he said:</p>

<p>“You will let me help you on the books, won’t you?
I know a lot about such things”—in reality he knew
nothing—“and I know a pack of big finance fellows in
New York who will patch up anything in the shape
of a note or mortgage or interest due. Do let me
help?”</p>

<p>“You really want to?”</p>

<p>“Really.”</p>

<p>“All right,” she agreed. “If you are not too tired
we can work over a few hard places before dinner. We
have an hour.”</p>

<p>This eager, plausible young man had better know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
exactly what he might expect out of “Red Jacket,”
and the earlier the better. The documents were not
such an enigma to her as she had pretended, and she
was not so young as not to be aware that men—and
mothers—had often speculated on her desirability as
a moneyed “catch.” Not that she believed Walter’s
theory about Richard. He was no “bad man.” Her
half-suspicions of Richard had faded almost as quickly
as they had come. The night’s sleep had banished
them. One might as well not have eyes and a mind
if the guileless man before her were ever guilty of
anything except kindness and improvidence. But improvidence
he could be guilty of, and on a colossal
scale. Besides, he was so different from other men
that it would be just like him to rest satisfied at
“Red Jacket.” He would take it with no more shame
than those sparrows were taking Phœbe’s oats. So she
would lead him straight to the documents and exhibit
the accounts.</p>

<p>When Phœbe heard their voices at the dock she fled
to the garden and seized a hoe. Reticence was not one
of her virtues, and she had the sense to know it. “It’s
awful to have the gift of oratory,” she chuckled as she
dived in back of the corn. “An’ it’s never myself that
thought I would be runnin’ away from a chance to
show it off!” Nevertheless she stayed out of sight
until they dressed and had left the cottage.</p>

<p>They took the steep hill leisurely, stopping occasionally
to rest and look back on the view; but they found
speech as unessential here as on the long swim together.
And, besides, the delicious fatigue had left little
inclination for conversation.</p>

<p>They crossed the single trolley track that led from
Penn Yan to Branchport and walked slowly up the lawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“Is there any better sensation than honest weariness?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“None in the world,” she agreed, although she
mentally made note of several better ones.</p>

<p>“Do you really feel like figures?” he asked temptingly.</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” she laughed, and noted his eager
look towards the little open summer-house before them.</p>

<p>“Let’s!” he suggested.</p>

<p>“All right,” she agreed.</p>

<p>There they lounged and looked down upon the Lake.</p>

<p>“Whose boat is that?” He pointed towards a
“Class A” yacht tacking across the Lake, evidently
aiming for Phœbe’s dock. “I believe it is Walter’s
boat with the new sails!”</p>

<p>They watched it for some time. As it drew nearer
they could make out two figures, evidently Walter
and Jawn. No doubt they had sailed up to Penn Yan
to get the new canvas. The <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> looked
splendid in her new suit and seemed almost self-conscious.
The races would begin next week, Jerry told
him. They speculated on the chances of success, and
grew loyally confident of “their” boat.</p>

<p>Neither of them wished to talk about Walter. The
subject brought up uncomfortable memories. Several
times she nerved herself to the point of telling him
the ruse she had employed to check Walter’s dangerous
suspicions, but each time she swerved off. Throbbing
blood-vessels warned her that she would not perform
with her accustomed calm. She was too tired, she
told herself. After she had fully recovered from the
long swim, she assured herself, she would make the
matter clear.</p>

<p>And several times he was on the point of letting her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
know that he knew. She must be told soon; one could
never be sure of Jawn’s indelicate humour. But his
old shyness would seize him at the critical moment. So
unwillingly their talk drifted to Mrs. Wells and the
accounts.</p>

<p>“Have you still your five dollars?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he laughed and produced his wallet. “This
is a fine place to live; there’s no way to spend money.
I think I’ll frame this bill as a souvenir.”</p>

<p>“You had better let me give you enough to pay for
a ticket to New York——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have no intention of going yet!” said he.</p>

<p>“We may all have to go sooner than any of us
suspect,” she met his gaiety with calm seriousness.</p>

<p>He waited for her to explain.</p>

<p>“If mother’s accounts are half-way right, I couldn’t
stay in Yates county,” she explained.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re not so bad as you think,” he encouraged.
“You just let me get at them. I’m a crackerjack
on accounts.”</p>

<p>She smiled. “I should think you would be!”</p>

<p>Her smile reassured him. If she knew the truth, he
argued, she would not be able to maintain that calm
assurance, showing once more that he did not know the
Virginia strain. So he found speech to prove what a
financial wonder he was. “There are friends of mine
in New York,” he said, “who could make any account
come out straight. There are thousands of ways of
fixing up money troubles. My friends are past-masters
in the art They have to be—that’s their business.”</p>

<p>“Can you stand a shock?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p>“If it is an interesting shock,” he answered.</p>

<p>“It is far from interesting,” she went on.... “We
owe nearly eighty thousand dollars. We haven’t even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
been paying the interest on our loans, and it is more
than our income; and our yearly expenses are enormous.
It looks to me as if the Wells family would
have to quit.”</p>

<p>It was indeed a shock. And she had known this for
days! That accounted for her preoccupied air and
the abrupt leaving of the luncheon table! But what
could account for her serene spirit? He asked her
bluntly.</p>

<p>She replied with a question. “Isn’t it your own
philosophy,” she asked, “to take events as you find
them?”</p>

<p>“Jerry,” he turned to her abruptly, “will you marry
me?”</p>

<p>She moved her head away. Even the Virginia strain
is susceptible to some shocks!</p>

<p>“What a poet you are, Richard,” she said.</p>

<p>“This is business,” he pursued the subject vehemently.
“Will you?”</p>

<p>“What a business man you are not!”</p>

<p>“Will you?”</p>

<p>He caught her shoulder and tried to turn her about
so that she would face him.</p>

<p>She remained rigid, remarking, “That’s my most
sunburned shoulder, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Look at me!” he commanded.</p>

<p>She moved about slowly and faced him. The smile
on her face was almost mournful. “It is still my most
sunburned shoulder,” she repeated, but did not flinch at
his heavy grasp.</p>

<p>“Will you?”</p>

<p>“You are a funny boy,” she remarked quietly. It
was less trouble to look into his earnest face than she
had thought. For a moment or two she forgot his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
question and busied herself with exploring the lines and
furrows and wondering how this young man ever got
so gnarled. Then she remembered and answered him.</p>

<p>“I like your poetry very much,” she said. “Very
much indeed. It is so like you.... It almost makes
me want to cry.... That’s because I’m tired....
But, Richard dear, it is also very, very comic.” He
was staring at her with the fiercest of frowns. “Especially
when you wrinkle your forehead like that....
You are the most chivalrous man I know. The Wells
family are about to go into the mire, and you rush to
the rescue with,” the smile on her face grew tender,
“with your little Sir Walter Raleigh coat of a five-dollar
bill. It is beautiful, Richard dear, and poetic,
and just like your generous self, but, alas, it would
not work.”</p>

<p>The summer-house was a most public affair. Either
from the porch of “Red Jacket” or from the road
anyone could have observed every movement. The
publicity had its effect, no doubt, but that was not his
reason for inaction. The poise of the woman shook his
resolution. He did not know that inwardly she was
shaken with agitation. In this stage every inexperienced
man is deceived. If he had taken her in his
arms boldly she would have gone without resistance,
even the passing of the Branchport trolley car might
not have interfered; but, instead, he talked earnestly
of his turbulent desire; and she met him with the
sex defence of beautiful calmness.</p>

<p>Then instead of taking him seriously, she twitted
him about his individualism and about his philosophy
of egoism.</p>

<p>“I’ve thrown that all overboard,” he insisted. “I’ve
been waiting for this moment all my life,” he cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
enthusiastically. “You don’t know how I have looked
curiously at this woman and at that woman wondering
if I were normal like other men, and if here or there
was the one who would stir the fires in me. I see
now what the trouble was; I was too self-conscious.
‘Happiness to be got must be forgot,’ George Palmer
used to tell us. And it has come on when I wasn’t
looking for it. But I played the game square. I
drifted on and had faith that this life is planned by
Intelligence. It’s no hit or miss. It’s as mapped out
as a liner’s chart.”</p>

<p>She was stirred by his vehemence and by the sudden
note of seriousness which she caught in his speech. If
he had chivalrously offered to marry her when she
seemed helpless and dependent she would have had
none of it. But chivalry does not make a man’s voice
shake or cause the tips of his fingers to burn like
hot coals as they touch one’s shoulder. She turned
eagerly to ask him—for she would make sure.</p>

<p>“When did you know this?”</p>

<p>“To-day at luncheon,” he drove on, “after you left.
Walter said that you had told him last night——”</p>

<p>“What!” She almost rose from her place beside
him. “Did he——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he went on clumsily, “he said that you had told
him that you and I had fixed things up and that——”</p>

<p>“Before the whole table?” she asked with deceiving
coolness.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “That is, to Jawn and me. Your
mother——”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she interrupted quietly, but with no concealment
of her irony, “just to you and Jawn! That
is some comfort. Jawn is such an uncommunicative
soul!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>“Oh, but don’t you see,” he tried to make it clear,
“that’s how I found out? I——”</p>

<p>“I presume he has written a limerick on the subject
by this time,” she laughed, but without mirth.
“That’s how you found out? Found out what,
pray?”</p>

<p>She had moved several inches away deliberately and
settled herself against one of the corners. She seemed
very self-possessed.</p>

<p>“Then I found out why I came here,” he persisted.
“If Walter had not spoken I might not have known.
But that minute I knew. You seemed to be talking to
me through him. I was never so stirred in my life;
the thing shot through me like a galvanic shock.
I went out into the gardens to try and get rid of
the thought. But it clung to me, followed me about,
danced in my brain and before my eyes all afternoon.
And when I saw you step out of that canoe—I knew.”</p>

<p>She lowered her head slightly and studied him for
several uncomfortable minutes. As the seconds ticked
by and her comic smile did not disappear his hopes
oozed, and left him face to face with harsh reality.</p>

<p>“And so I made eyes at you, after all,” she remarked
bitterly, although the set smile did not leave her. She
moved back further, threw her feet up on the bench,
clasped her knees and looked at him through half-closed
lids, as one might gaze at a likeable bad boy. “I made
eyes at you via Walter, did I? And you did not run
away as you promised.”</p>

<p>He protested as a man might in such circumstances,
but she continued to gaze at him satirically until he
was compelled to halt.</p>

<p>“I suppose my younger brother’s statements are all
to be taken as gospel,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>“Well, of course——” he began.</p>

<p>She went on firmly. “He was so exquisitely truthful
about the trunks at Naples, and we’ve told you of
other instances. Naturally he is to be believed.”</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t say——”</p>

<p>“<i>Absolutely not!</i>” she cried.</p>

<p>After all, she was in a way telling the truth. She
had not made an intentional sentimental confession to
Walter. She had told him what she had believed to be
a necessary invention, and learned only later that it
was in reality the truth.</p>

<p>Everything she had said to Walter had been done
with the lightest of motives; and this clumsy man
before her was making her action shameful. The thing
he suggested, <i>that</i> she had not said—absolutely not!</p>

<p>Tears glistened in her eyes, tears of vexation and
anger. She rose and started to go.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he cried and detained her by force. He
would not have her go that way. When she would not
sit down he in turn grew angry. His eyes shot fire and
his speech was most unnaturally rough. If she could
not stand misunderstanding, neither could he! She
had not heard his whole story, but by the lord Harry,
she should! And this time he made himself clear.</p>

<p>“I believe you had told Walter exactly what he
repeated to us, and when you consider that the boy is
a half-idiot——”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, but he heeded her interruption
not at all.</p>

<p>“—I could easily understand that you had some
good reason for telling him that or any other story that
would come into your head. I did not say I believed
you meant it. Woman, do you think I’m a complete
fool? I thought perhaps you had lied to him, as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
would do if it were necessary; maybe he was violent,
I thought, and you had to say something to keep him
quiet! The point is—this much I thought you would
have the wit to understand—the point is that the
suggestion overpowered me, made me conscious of what
had been true from the moment I followed you here,
but what I did not know until that moment, that—oh,
well,” he tried to calm his violence, “what’s the use?
You either feel the same as I do, or you don’t; and
nothing can force you.... Only I’m sorry....
Sorry.”</p>

<p>“I really believe you were angry.”</p>

<p>“I still am.”</p>

<p>“Did I hurt you?”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!”</p>

<p>“It is so interesting to discover that you can be
insulted after all, you who were so insult-proof.”</p>

<p>“I was never so hurt in my life.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she was very deliberate, “it is a good lesson
for you. You’ll have much more sympathy for sensitive
folks hereafter.”</p>

<p>The turbulence subsided. It had been rather noisy
for a moment or two—both voices had risen—all of
which made the ensuing silence rather awkward. Jerry
seemingly had remained serene throughout; but the
man was naturally shaken—he had exhibited quite a
new variety of Richard. But even he gradually got
control of himself.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” he began the conversation. “Suppose
I am able to fix up the accounts,” he ventured; “will
you let me have a try at it?”</p>

<p>“What would you do?” she asked. But before he
could answer she said, “I don’t want you to think that
I am not terribly concerned about ‘Red Jacket.’ I may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
not show it, but I feel those debts, especially the money
we owe to the——” she could not tell him that disgrace,
but he knew she was about to say “to the negroes”—“especially
some of the debts,” she corrected herself;
“I feel the whole thing so keenly that nothing else
matters.... I am not likely to show a thing like
that.... There are many things I am not likely to
show.... It’s pride, I suppose; but we Virginians—oh,
I’m a Virginian!—are proud of our pride; it is the
one possession we have been taught to hold to....
When we sell out or borrow on that! well, we’re done
for!... It is a great wrench to tell you even this
much, but you have misunderstood me more than
once——”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Jerry,” he asked so sincerely that for
a moment she hardly dared go on.</p>

<p>“Let’s go home,” she spoke abruptly and rose.</p>

<p>At the porch he asked her again to let him help with
the finances.</p>

<p>“Someone must do it,” she said; “it might as well
be you. It’s like the business of hiring an undertaker,”
she smiled squarely at him, gamely, “and you might as
well get the job. I’ll turn the papers over to you
to-night, and the quicker you get at it the better. No,”
she changed her mind. “Don’t do anything until after
the races next week. And don’t be surprised, Richard
dear,” she reverted to the phrase she had used at the
top of the hill back of Naples, “if you find me quite
careless and birdlike for the next few days. We own
‘Red Jacket’ until it is sold out from under us. I’ll not
let that sale begin in my mind until it begins in fact.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he joked, “don’t you be too sure that it will
be sold at all! Remember that I’m the financial manager
now! I’m on the job, and don’t you forget it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>“Poet!” she tapped him ever so gently on the arm,
“dear, good, kind, blue-eyed, impractical poet!”</p>

<p>He followed her to the stairs and watched her go
slowly up to her room. At the turn in the landing she
stopped and looked down upon him. If he had been a
bolder man he would have known that now at last she
was deliberately “making eyes at him,” but when she
shook her head with comic dolefulness and murmured,
“Poet!” he saw only a beautiful sympathy for an
unrequited affection!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>THE COUNCIL FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wells’</span> “books” were not arranged to facilitate
the work of an auditor, but her correspondence was of
considerable help. With the aid of Jerry’s notes and
the letters Richard was able to get his clues. At
occasional intervals Mitchell Lear’s brief notes would
come along, each such invariable good sense that
Richard began to have a liking for the man before he
had seen him. Evidently Lear had been consulted
before each disastrous transaction, and his advice was
always to refrain from doing what events proved should
have not been done. His terse opinions were worded
with almost humorous sameness: “As I advised you
in our talk on Wednesday, you will do well not to
dispose of the orchards” or “not to try out experiments
in grape spraying,” and so on. Mr. Lear was evidently
a friend and a man of sound judgment; and in compensation
for his long failure to have his advice followed
he was a good man to consult now.</p>

<p>Mitchell Lear was engaged in bowing a client out of
the office when Richard appeared.</p>

<p>“It is the sort of case I never touch,” Mr. Lear was
saying. There was a note of firm indignation in his
voice, which his nervous, eager client seemed to miss.</p>

<p>“But your reputation at the bar would help us
so——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>“My reputation at the bar is not for sale!” Mr. Lear
interrupted ominously. “I am busy. Good-day, sir.”</p>

<p>“But if you could only see your way——”</p>

<p>“Good-day, sir!”</p>

<p>Some of the indignation still lingered in Mr. Lear’s
keen eyes as he confronted Richard. The lawyer had
the judicial rather than the legal face, and at this
moment it was that of the righteous judge in the act of
sentencing a deserving criminal.</p>

<p>“I am Mr. Richard,” he held out a hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Mr. Lear took the hand firmly.
“You are staying with the Wells’ at ‘Red Jacket.’
There was a note of the fact in the local papers,” he
added by way of explanation. “Sit down. Excuse me
if I seemed ruffled. That little rat was just about
to—well, we won’t talk about it.”</p>

<p>His face remained stern as he looked expectantly
towards Richard.</p>

<p>“You are Mrs. Wells’ lawyer, I believe,” Richard
began.</p>

<p>The penetrating gaze of the lawyer was somewhat
disconcerting; but at Richard’s question the immovable
features relaxed into the most genial of smiles and the
eyes broke into abrupt laughter.</p>

<p>“Not that I know it,” Mr. Lear chuckled. “I am
simply her good friend. As such I give advice free.
She always comes to me when she wants help in a bit of
wrongdoing.”</p>

<p>The words seemed out of character with the man
who had just dismissed a client who, no doubt, had
been suggesting a shady legal partnership; but the
face shone with delight in the paradoxical situation.</p>

<p>“When Mrs. Wells wishes to do something which she
knows is quite unwise,” Mr. Lear explained, “something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
which her conscience tells her she should never do, she
comes to me to get her will strengthened. She knows
beforehand that I will decide against her and give her
advice which she doesn’t want to take, but without
opposition she is weak and vacillating. I am the man
she selects to arouse her combativeness. The more
clearly I prove the folly of her proposed undertaking
the stronger grows her resolution to undertake it. She
usually comes into my office in a mood of guilty
indecision, but she always goes out righteously obstinate
and determined to do exactly the opposite of everything
I suggest.”</p>

<p>Richard knew that she would act exactly in that way,
and he told Mr. Lear so; he told him also of the change
that had come over her and the reason for it; and, as
well, of Jerry’s assumption of command. Then he
sorted out the papers and the notes on the correspondence.
There was a name here and there of a note-holder,
a generous note-holder it seemed, who seemed to take
the non-payment of interest as a sort of lark.</p>

<p>Mr. Lear knew him; he was a distant relative of the
Wells’—Uncle John they called him, although he was
no uncle—and a man whose name should be Great-heart.
But Mr. Lear did not know of the shocking
financial state of “Red Jacket.” The smile left his
face as he ran down the summary which Richard had
prepared. Uncle John was generous, but it was not
likely that he would be willing to underwrite so large a
deficit, especially as the present income from the estate
showed no chance of catching up with the expenses.</p>

<p>“She has too many negroes,” Mr. Lear pointed out.
“They eat up all the profits. She will not get rid of
them; but, at least, she ought to employ them properly.”</p>

<p>“How could she do that?” Richard asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>“Buy back the orchards she sold Hoskins,” he
answered promptly. “Hoskins will sell, at a profit,
of course. Then she should get Holloday’s orchards
and Fennill’s and go into the business on a big scale. I
shouldn’t advise more grape land, although I would
most strongly suggest letting George Alexander manage
the sprays in his own way; she interferes with absolutely
original theories—all wrong, of course—and she
drags off his negroes to fool with her gardens.”</p>

<p>Richard was taking rapid notes.</p>

<p>“Will you get an option on Hoskins’ apples for us,”
he looked up eagerly, “and on Fennill’s and the other
fellow’s, too?”</p>

<p>“I am no real-estate operator,” Mitchell Lear
assumed his most judicial expression.</p>

<p>How proud everyone was in Yates county, Richard
thought; but he said genially, “But as a friend——”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Lear laughed at the touch. “That is
different. As a friend I would get an option on the
Lake-side cemetery!”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Richard. “And can you get those
notes from—Uncle John, I believe you said; I mean
if we raise the money?... As a friend!”</p>

<p>“As a friend,” Lear entered into the scheme, “I will
try to get the notes without the interest! Uncle John
ought to be glad to get the principal! But how are
you going to find all that money?”</p>

<p>“May I use your telephone?” Richard asked politely,
as if he merely intended to talk to “Red Jacket.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is for,” said Mr. Lear. He was
engaged seriously in checking off the accounts, but he
raised his head in astonishment when he heard Richard
ask for the name of one of the best known banking
houses in New York city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>“I want Mr. Davis Clarkson,” Richard told the
operator. “No; no one else will do.... What?
Oh! You can’t get them right away? When? In
about ten minutes.... Oh!... I am to do what?
Hang what? Oh, yes; I see. I am to hang up the
receiver until you get Mr. Clarkson for me....
Yes.... I understand. Thank you very much—very
much indeed.”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t intend to hold a very long conversation
with Mr. Clarkson,” Mr. Lear remarked
grimly. “I forget whether it is one dollar or two
dollars a minute to talk to New York. But I’m
relieved to find you didn’t open up Chicago or
Denver!”</p>

<p>“Clarkson will pay,” Richard assured him. “Clarkson
has heaps of money.”</p>

<p>“You are not very used to the long-distance
telephone,” the lawyer remarked shrewdly.</p>

<p>“No,” Richard admitted. “I have rarely talked on
any telephone. No; I don’t believe I ever tried before
to talk over any great distance. How did you know
that?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lear laughed.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he said. “You do it very daintily,
and you talk to the operator as if she were about to do
you a personal favour. There goes the bell. That
means you, I judge. Politeness pays; you’ve opened
up New York city in record time.”</p>

<p>“Is that you, Dave?” Richard applied himself
eagerly.... “Sure it is! The very same! I’ve been
at Penn Yan, New York. Put it down. Yes. Red
Jacket, Penn Yan. Can you take a vacation and come
up?... Well, listen and you’ll change your mind, for
I’ve changed mine.... Yes.... That’s it. I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
come over, just as you said I would; and now I want
money.... About a hundred and fifty thousand....
Can’t you bring it along with you?... Very well;
any way you choose. I’m buying vineyards and apple
orchards up here.... Yes; great spec.... Millions
in it.... And wait!” He glanced at his notes. “Look
up Noble, French and Company, and buy the mortgage
to ‘Red Jacket.’... Mrs. Emma Wells.... Yates
county.... Well, that will do, only I’d much rather
have you by me to see that everything is O.K....
Wait.... Make that cheque out to Mitchell Lear....
Certified? Oh, all right, if that’s the proper way to do
it.... No; I’d prefer to have it made out to Mitchell
Lear.” He spelled the name carefully. “He’ll give
me what I want. Yes, Mitchell Lear, Penn Yan, New
York.... Yes, a hundred and fifty thousand will be
quite enough, thank you, Dave.... Good-bye, old
Dave!”</p>

<p>Richard turned quietly to the astonished lawyer. “Did
you catch the conversation with Clarkson? He’s going
to send you a cheque, certified cheque, for $150,000.
I don’t want to be known in this, so I’ll draw on you
when I want funds. You see we just have to fix up the
Wells’ business, and what’s the use of having money if
you can’t have some fun with it! I bet you are enjoying
the prospect almost as much as I am. But we’ve
got to do this with great cunning and delicacy; you
know how proud everybody is in these parts!”</p>

<p>Lear was not only struck in a heap by the nonchalant
attitude of the young man towards this rather
large sum of money, but he was correspondingly
elevated at the splendid trust imposed in him. It
was startling to have a stranger exhibit such faith.
Further evidence of that stranger’s faith was forthcoming.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
Mr. Richard Richard laid off his incognito and
he made clear his desires in settling up the troubles of
the Wells estate; all of which Mr. Mitchell Lear was to
perform as legal adviser, real-estate operator and friend,
but shrouded, of course, in deepest secrecy.</p>

<p>“Will you conspire with me?” Richard asked.</p>

<p>“Will I?” echoed Mitchell Lear. “You won’t find
a more willing conspirator in twenty counties.”</p>

<p>“Remember,” Richard told him, “this is strictly
business. You are to get your proper fees and all that
sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Young man,” the elder man rose and fastened him
with his steel-grey eyes. “Young man, go to the
devil!”</p>

<p>“But at least the telephone call——”</p>

<p>“Young man,” Mitchell Lear grew eloquent, “<i>go to
the devil</i>!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Richard as he wrung his hand in parting,
“I’ll get even.”</p>

<p>The young man went down Main Street with a
springy step. His life had suddenly flopped over, like
a turtle, as he had said, and he was as eager to follow
up the new experience as the said turtle to try out his
unused legs. Sam Fybush’s neat tailoring establishment
caught his eye; he went in and had himself
measured for clothes, giving Mitchell Lear’s name as
reference; and he walked in Hopkin’s jewellery store and
began buying an assortment of rings, but stopped when
he realized that his funds would not arrive for a day or
two. He never before had such a flurry to spend; he
was like a child with birthday money. “Lord!” he
thought, “I’d be dangerous to let loose in Tiffany’s just
now!”</p>

<p>To Richard Richard there was nothing inconsistent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
in his sudden consuming desire to take up his inheritance.
So long as one was honest with his desires
nothing could be inconsistent to this young man. One
might as well be disturbed over an eclipse of the moon.
The law of his individual life was operating without
flaw, he assured himself; and he was glad that he had
never tried to impose artificially upon the perfect
mechanism. Yesterday he was a communist; to-day
he was a champion of property. Very well; and to-morrow
he might be a Buddhist—it was all in the hands
of the gods.</p>

<p>For that reason, perhaps, or for reasons deeper than
he knew, he felt only the slightest undercurrent of disappointment
over his failure in the conquest of Jerry.
It would come out all right, was the burden of his
faith. He would wait and try, in this as in other
high matters, to accept cheerfully the predestined
course of things.</p>

<p>The week slipped by more smoothly than either
Richard or Jerry had expected. Richard was busy with
his new interest, the financial rehabilitation of “Red
Jacket,” and Jerry threw herself into the arrangement
of a lawn dinner-party which should signalize, as she
thought, her farewell to Jerusalem township. With
characteristic singleness of mind she could launch all the
preparations without a thought as to what she should
do after the curtain had been rung down. In many
respects she was true to the traditions of her family:
they had always lived in the immediate present. It is
interesting to note that difference between Massachusetts
and Virginia, even more noticeable if one contrasts
Maine and Georgia: the North has looked ever towards
the future, while the South has lived. The one has
grown thrifty and has paid the penalty of prosperity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
while the other has paid many times over the penalty of
unpreparedness.</p>

<p>Mitchell Lear was Northern in his sense of future
values. He had a long head, as we say, meaning that
he did not deceive himself as to the eventual outcome of
things; and, as well, that he knew the game of bargaining.
Hoskins sold eagerly; he had bought the Wells’
apple land because it was offered at a low figure;
his main object was to sell at a profit. Fennill and
Holloday sold because they were in need of cash, and
because they had no knowledge of the real value of
orchards properly cared for. To this lot was added a
valuable tract of young trees not yet bearing which a
wealthy summer visitor had started in the frenzy of
a sudden interest and which he had grown tired of with
equal suddenness.</p>

<p>On the day before the first yacht race—it took three
wins to achieve the Lake cup—Richard sought Jerry
out to present her with a summary of operations.</p>

<p>He explained that a friend of his in New York, Davis
Clarkson, had bought in the mortgage and the notes
and was willing to give unlimited time. In addition his
friend had lent money for the purchase of apple lands
in order that the estate might employ all the negroes
and offer some chance for a return. These lands were
held in Clarkson’s name and not charged against the
estate at all—not very business-like, but friendship
will do wonders at times. Richard was not so clear in
his explanations, but his summary was understandable.</p>

<p>“The sinking fund, you see,” he explained, “will pay
off the whole indebtedness in much less than twenty
years, because every year the interest will grow less.
And we have nearly $8,000 a year above all expenses—to
provide for accidents and pin-money! Mitchell Lear
says that George Alexander and young Bolivar should
be given four times their present wages and put absolutely
in charge of the orchards and the grapes. Those
two men know fruit by instinct, but even at that you
ought to be willing to pay out about two thousand
a year for expert advice on soils and spray mixture.
We’re calculating, you see, on getting every cent out of
those lands.”</p>

<p>Jerry studied the report for a long time. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
searching for some act of charity, the tiniest morsel
of which would have meant repudiation of the whole
scheme.</p>

<p>“That means,” she spoke at last, “that we keep
‘Red Jacket,’ and make the attempt to pay off the debt
against it?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that many times,” she remarked
quietly, as if she were trying to hold back some pent-up
emotion, “but the best figures I could make showed
income always less than out-go. And I could not dismiss
the negroes, not ... not after ... not after I
had seen what we....”</p>

<p>She could not put it into words. There are some
things which the spirit rebels against saying aloud.</p>

<p>“But the new orchard lands!” Richard broke in.
“They do the trick. Everything depends upon getting
use out of the labour you have.”</p>

<p>“Wait.” She pondered over the figures before her,
seeking some sign of philanthropy.</p>

<p>“What does your friend Clarkson get out of it?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“He’s a banker; don’t you see? He is protected by
interest on loans. And he holds the mortgage and the
title to the new lands. Oh, it’s absolutely business,
every bit of it.”</p>

<p>So it seemed, but she was still suspicious.</p>

<p>“You give only $15,000 for land which almost pays
for itself in one year. How can that be done?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“You’ve struck the one flaw in the statement,” he
laughed. “I’ve just put things in round figures and,
of course, everything is not there. It will take several
years to get the full income out of that land, but when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
it does come it will be greater even than the figure we
give—that figure is just an average over a number of
years. Oh! I know my lesson well; Mitchell Lear is a
fine teacher!”</p>

<p>She was not satisfied.</p>

<p>“Why, then,” she asked, “doesn’t this Clarkson man
work the land himself and not let us have all this
profit? It looks to me like a gift.”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Richard.</p>

<p>“What!” she bristled.</p>

<p>“It is an outright gift of Mitchell Lear’s wise brain.
You might ask why Lear doesn’t take the thing up as a
personal speculation. The reason is that he is a lawyer
by natural selection. He is a genius at making money,
too; he told me a dozen ways to turn over cash right
in this neighbourhood, but he’s a lawyer first, last and
all the time. Or you might ask why Fennill and
Holloday and Hoskins don’t go into the apple business
properly. The answer is simple, they couldn’t if they
wanted to; they haven’t the brains, Lear says. He
says that some of those fellows haven’t brains enough
to raise dandelions! No; you’ve got to take off your
hat to Mitchell Lear. He’s as loyal to this family as
George Alexander.”</p>

<p>“I would not accept a cent as a gift,” said Jerry
firmly, “but I would take much in the name of
loyalty.”</p>

<p>To cover any possible misunderstanding of her last
remark she asked quickly, “Suppose the income does
not reach your expectations?”</p>

<p>“It’s a risk,” he admitted, “like all living. But I
am trusting Mitchell Lear on those figures. He knows
what is being done by careful grape and apple farmers
hereabouts—the most scientific fellows—and he knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
what ‘Red Jacket’ used to get before the spray experiment
began, and he claims that he has made no
over-statements. The biggest asset ‘Red Jacket’ has,
he says, is its loyal labour, and the fortunate possession
among the negroes of a half-dozen men like George
Alexander and Bolivar, who have an uncanny knowledge
of all this new tree and vine lore; and a still
more uncanny knowledge of how to make those negroes
work! It looks to me like good business,” he examined
the sheet proudly; “and you haven’t said a word about
my magnificent financial engineering.”</p>

<p>She reached forward and patted him on the arm.</p>

<p>“It is magnificent!” she said. “Wonderful! I
thought you were an impractical dreamer, and here you
present me with a magician’s wand.... I did not
realize—no, I really did not—what ‘Red Jacket’ meant
to me.... And it is fortunate that I didn’t. I felt
so cold and ... benumbed, because of the whole ugly
business that I believe I should have walked out of
that door and down the path without a tear, without
even once looking back at old ‘Tshoti’ and ‘Da’ and
‘Waga.’... You are a very wonderful, practical man,
Richard-my-dear, but ... I liked you just as well as
poet.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” he said, “there’s the rub. ‘Just as well!’
Do you remember Mark Twain’s statement that he
could speak seven languages ‘equally well’?... But,
forgive me. I am not going to bother you again.”</p>

<p>She looked straight at him, her head bent slightly
and her eyes glancing up through half-closed lids. It
was a mask of a face she presented, absolutely poised,
with all expression removed save a flirting gleam about
the eyes and the faintest suggestion of a smile on the
lips. The steady gaze was too much for him; somehow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
it shamed him and made the blood slowly rise to his
face. His ear-tips had begun to burn when he arose
abruptly and asked:</p>

<p>“Will you do me a favour for all my hard work?”</p>

<p>It would depend; she was also business-like and did
not make impossible promises. But he did not want
much; he asked merely for the key to “Grandfather’s
Room” where the relics of Chief Red Jacket were kept.</p>

<p>She would do more than give him the key; she
would personally conduct him.</p>

<p>“But it must be done with ancient ceremonies,” she
detained him a moment at the door. “Wait here
until I give you the sign. Enter not,” she raised her
hand in mock seriousness, “enter not, paleface, until
you are summoned to the council!”</p>

<p>She went off, presumably for the key, while he
waited before the door of “Grandfather’s Room.”
Many minutes slipped by but he was not conscious of
them; his mind was elsewhere. Suddenly the door
opened from within and an Indian maiden stood before
him.</p>

<p>“Welcome, paleface,” she said.</p>

<p>The paleface took one step within the big room, and
looked about him with the keenest curiosity. He was
gazing on an Indian village. There were wigwams,
birch cabins, totem poles, and a score of Indian figures
carved rudely out of wood. The latter were posed
about in characteristic attitudes: making arrows,
grinding corn on rounded stones, pounding at skins.
There were squaws carrying babies and, far off among
the rushes, a set of warriors in full regalia were sweeping
forward in a war canoe. In the centre of the room
the sachems squatted about a council fire.</p>

<p>She took him from group to group, showed him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
beads, the belts, wampum; the hides, the arrows and
the primitive knives and weapons, the pottery and
a-hundred-and-one other things. About the wall were
scores of documents, framed evidently in more modern
times and protected by glass. These were descriptions
in Great-grandfather Wells’ hand—he had the spirit
of an antiquary—descriptions of this and that native
occupation, but, more important, many transcripts
at first hand of the sayings of the famous Seneca
orator, “Red Jacket.”</p>

<p>“Jove!” Richard cried. “This is more important
than grapes and apples!”</p>

<p>He did not specify what exactly was more important
than grapes and apples, but she knew that he meant
“Red Jacket” and its treasures made by generations
of right living. Here were memories and traditions
that could not be bought in the market, nor could they
be moved about or transplanted. Deep family roots
were here, and he knew that some of the fine flower
of that family would fade and wither were it forced
to seek other ground.</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” she replied in thorough understanding.</p>

<p>“And I’m more glad than ever that I bought up
‘Red Jacket’ for you. You couldn’t have walked
out, woman, and left all this!”</p>

<p>He waved his hand about excitedly.</p>

<p>She caught only the latter part of his speech.</p>

<p>“I know I couldn’t,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it wonderful,” he turned to her, “that just
at this moment in your life the Great Spirit should
have sent me to you?”</p>

<p>“I believe He sent you,” she told him gravely.</p>

<p>Her low tone thrilled him. He bent over eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>“Thank God I have money!” he half whispered.
“Millions of it! Millions of it to spend on you!
To buy you a thousand Big Houses, if you want them.
You knew all along, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>He reached out a nervous hand and lightly touched
her.</p>

<p>“Knew what?”</p>

<p>She asked the question, but she was conscious only
of the electric nearness of the man.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t Walter told you? He had my card. I
thought he had told. When——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said quietly. “But you are not——”</p>

<p>“I am,” he smiled grimly. “Does it make me less
repulsive?”</p>

<p>“But that name! It—it can’t he. He is——”</p>

<p>“My father is dead, yes. We had the same name.”
In rapid sentences he sketched his history. As he
talked she moved a step away from him and stood
rigid.</p>

<p>“And you bought up ‘Red Jacket’ and presented it
to me?” she asked, her face aflame.</p>

<p>He nodded, totally unprepared for the outburst that
followed.</p>

<p>“Oh, how could you? How could you?” she cried.
“I can’t take it!” She stamped her foot. With
every energetic protestation the three royal plumes in
her head-dress quivered in sympathetic response. “I
<i>won’t</i> take it!” Her anger grew. “Why did you
keep this from me? Why didn’t you tell me before
who you were?” In bitter speeches she upbraided him
for his calm, smiling, superior secrecy.</p>

<p>He tried to explain that the secrecy was largely her
own doing, but she would not have it that way. He
had been playing with her, having his premeditated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
joke and then in the end had offered—<i>alms</i>! Very
well! Very well! Tears were raining down her cheek,
her speech was almost hysteric. Very well! She
would leave as she had planned; but not until she got
good and ready. “Red Jacket” was her home until
she left it for good. “Oh! Richard Richard!” she
exclaimed bitterly as she brushed past him, “this
was a low trick to play on me!”</p>

<p>The door was slammed in his face or he might have
followed her; and as it locked of itself in some
mysterious manner he was compelled to tread his way
back among the silent Indians and through a series
of adjacent rooms to the main hall.</p>

<p>Once more an Indian council fire had broken up in a
declaration of war!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>THE RACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the day of the first boat race Professor Jawn
Galloway had become a perfect tender of “stays,” and
an enthusiastic champion of <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> against
the world. Richard was mustered in as the other
“stay tender,” and the Wheelen boy volunteered
for jib and spinnaker. There was no questioning,
of course, of Walter’s position; the captain is always
the helmsman and in complete charge of the yacht.</p>

<p>During the morning the crew tried out their various
“tricks” and at noon dropped anchor before Alley’s
Inn, which since the days of the old Keuka Yacht Club
had been the starting point of the Lake races. The
distance was approximately twelve miles, three times
around a triangular course, beginning at Alley’s Inn,
thence across the Lake to Willow Grove and up to the
North Buoy and back.</p>

<p>At noon the wind dropped to a light breeze which
faded into nothingness by one o’clock. At two, however,
the Lake was white with racing “caps.” A
characteristic sudden southwester had sprung out of
the hills and was sweeping up the Lake. In the cove
before Alley’s Inn the boats were securely sheltered,
but once beyond the little headlands the fragile yachts
felt the full sweep of the gale and bent over perilously
and tugged at their side stays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>Automobiles were parking on the lawn, the trolley
line was running extra cars, and motor-boats were chugging
over from every part of the Lake. There was
great curiosity to see the trial of the new yacht, but
greater to see the erratic Walter Wells in the rôle
of skipper. Alley’s Inn was doing a big business.
Luncheon tables overflowed to the wide porches and
even on to the lawn.</p>

<p>Richard looked about him for Geraldine. He did
not see her; but Phœbe was in evidence. Phœbe was
at a table with Mrs. Wells and Walter. The boy was
eating little, but he was obviously pleased at Phœbe’s
solicitous attention. She fluttered over him like a
young hen, if a young hen could ever be gay, witty
and encouraging, and could “burble” effervescently.
After all, thought Richard, Walter was her “case.”
It was she who had suggested yachting; she had even
named the boat. She was the only one with any
practical influence over the boy.</p>

<p>Evidently Jerry did not intend to lunch at Alley’s
Inn. She had not appeared at breakfast. Sukie said
she had gone off dressed in a walking gown—a short-skirted
grey corduroy. Sukie said she went off just
before sunrise and that she had taken “Count” with
her.</p>

<p>Her reaction in “Grandfather’s Room” had been
exactly opposite of Richard’s expectation. Her main
anger, it seems, had been over the secrecy which she
herself had originated, and which circumstances had
prolonged. She had been a willing enough conspirator
there, but, it appears, the conspirator had been conspired
against. She believed that she was in the secret
all along, and it turned out in the end that she had
been completely out of it. The startling conclusion—rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
man coming so pat to rescue the bankrupt heiress!—had
been too much of a surprise; indeed, it seemed
almost in the nature of a carefully-planned joke at her
expense. That, no doubt, was part of the cause for her
outburst, he reasoned.</p>

<p>Another cause, perhaps, was her pride in possession;
she loved independence and hated dependence. How
Virginia has always hated a tyrant! Her code would
not permit her to be under permanent obligations to
anyone. There must always be a chance to pay back,
to make equal return; and what chance was here?—a
bankrupt estate against millions.</p>

<p>There was another cause which Richard did not get—many
others, indeed, but chief among them was the
fact that Richard helpless and dependent upon her was
a satisfactory situation, but Richard independent could
fare his way whenever the so-called “spirit” should
move him. His new rôle would make Jerry relatively
the beggar-maid and Richard the opulent distributor
of largess. She could not stand that. It was abhorrent.
All her training was against succumbing to
superiority.</p>

<p>Upon one phase of the case Richard knew his
ground. He had noted the change in her the moment
they had crossed the threshold of “Red Jacket.” On
board the steamer she had been a lively, intelligent,
well-bred American, not to be distinguished from
others of that delightful group; but the transfer to her
own lands transformed her. In Europe she was one of
many; at “Red Jacket” she was Somebody.</p>

<p>One time on the way home Mrs. Wells had confided
to Richard that she would be glad to get home.
“Europe is always wonderful, but I could not live
there,” she said. Richard confessed that he could live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
anywhere. But she shook her head, “In Europe I am
one of a crowd; in Jerusalem township I am a Person
with a capital P. There we have been the big family,
for ever, it seems; and we have come to act and react
like Persons. Out of Jerusalem township I always feel
like a king without a country.”</p>

<p>The big house and the grounds and the servants were
necessary background to bring out Geraldine Wells.
And she fitted into them naturally, not like someone
presuming to be a Person, but as one manor-born.</p>

<p>While Richard cogitated these weighty personal
matters he was standing on the high embankment overlooking
the Lake and seemed to be watching Fagner as
he manœuvred the <i>Moodiks</i> in the growing gale. Here
Jawn joined him.</p>

<p>“Whoop-la!” Jawn cried. The <i>Moodiks</i> had
flapped over suddenly. “She almost went over that
time! It’s a life-preserver I’ll be needing if this blow
keeps up. What’s that? Thunder? Shiver-me-timbers,
but it looks squally over to the sou’ by sou’-sou’-sou’-west.
Excuse me for the technical language,
old hoss.”</p>

<p>“Is ‘old hoss’ technical?” Richard inquired without
turning around.</p>

<p>“No, you jackass,” Jawn replied serenely. “I was
referring to the nautical language. With white pants
on I feel ridiculously nautical. Have you seen my
white hat?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well then, have you seen your own white hat?”</p>

<p>“Have I a white hat?”</p>

<p>“How in the blazes do you suppose you can tend
‘stays’ in a real yacht race for a silver cup unless you
wear a white hat? You might as well seek an audience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
at Buckingham Palace in overalls and blickey; or play
tennis in a dress-suit; or football in pyjamas; or—you’re
not listening at all.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” Richard came out of his reverie. “Oh! So
I have a hat, have I?”</p>

<p>Jawn sighed disconsolately.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of the gift of speech,” he groaned,
“if nobody has the gift of listening to it?”</p>

<p>“Go on, Jawn,” Richard turned pleasantly. “I’m
listening. But I couldn’t get my attention away from
the <i>Moodiks</i>. Fagner’ll have to take a reef in, don’t
you think? I don’t believe he’ll go over, but he’ll
waste so much time coming up into the wind; and that
breeze is mighty gusty to-day.”</p>

<p>“What do I care what happens to him?” Jawn
asked. “The more time he takes the better we’ll like
it. We’re going to win.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jawn, “I’ve timed the <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i>
and she gets over ground better than the best records
they have here. We did the whole course the other day
in sixteen seconds less than the old <i>Tecumseh</i>, which
holds the record. And besides I spent my good money
on white sailor hats with blue bands on ’em. Wait till
you see the blue bands with ‘<i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i>’ printed
in gold! Yum! We’ll look like regulars off a battleship.
Walter’s eyes nearly popped out of his head
when I presented him with his.”</p>

<p>Richard began to show interest.</p>

<p>“The boy has changed wonderfully, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>Jawn dropped his bantering tone. Into his face came
the serious gleam of the specialist; his holiday carelessness
disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>“You’re quite right,” he said. “The boy’s got stuff
in him. We’ve been chumming around a bit this past
week. I thought he was a plain ‘moron,’ at first—not
an idiot, but slightly off the normal, you know—but
I’ve changed completely on that. I’ve been giving
him all sorts of tests on the quiet. You were absolutely
right in your first diagnosis. Drink is not his ‘primary,’
it’s this yacht business. In some ways he’s a
fool, but not on board the <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i>! That’s <i>his</i>,
his very own. It’s the first sensation of genuine ownership
he’s ever had, and it fills him so full of pride and
self-glorification that his small brain hasn’t room for
anything else. The only thing I fear is that he won’t
be able to stand a loss to-day. I’ve tried to prepare him
for it, but he won’t think of losing. I’m afraid we’ve
got to win this race, if we have to make a short cut
across one of the buoys and trust that the judges aren’t
looking.”</p>

<p>Tyler, the skipper of the <i>Cohlosa</i>, came up at this
juncture. The men had met before.</p>

<p>“My friend, the enemy!” cried Jawn, shaking hands
vigorously. “Old <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> is after your scalp
to-day, Tyler. The <i>Cohlosa</i> had better hold on tight to
her hair-ribbons and stand ready to yell police any
minute.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Cohlosa</i> is easily frightened,” said Tyler
genially. “We have run away from a number of fierce
boats.”</p>

<p>Phœbe saw the men together and slipped over to
them. Walter had gone on board the <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i>.</p>

<p>“Don’t quarrel, now,” she said. “Try to keep your
tempers, men. I know how you feel, but hide it. Pretend
at least to be friends. I’m shakin’ hands with you,
Mr. Tyler, but I’m countin’ my beads for <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
and rainin’ my last curses on the <i>Cohlosa</i>, bad cess
to it!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry,” smiled Tyler; “for they say that
the prayer of the righteous availeth much.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t talk that way!” she protested. “I
must keep all the fires of hatred goin’, an’ how can I
hate you properly, man, when you blarney me so beautifully?
I never was the one to stand out against a
man who’d flattered me. Well, I hope you come in second,
then, Mr. Tyler, but don’t tell me any more pretty
lies or I’ll be wishin’ it a tie race. An’ now, as man to
woman, Mr. Tyler, give us a tip. Do you think we
have a chance? An’ is there any little thing you can
suggest to help us beat you?”</p>

<p>“Votes for women!” cried Jawn. “Wait till they
carry on a Presidential campaign, boys. We’ll all be
confessing to bribery and ballot-stuffing weeks before
we start to do the crooked work. Own up, Tyler, that
you’ve got a gasolene engine concealed under the rudder.
Or perhaps you’ll oblige a lady by boring a few auger
holes in the bottom.”</p>

<p>“Jawn Galloway!” Phœbe turned on him. “How
can you have the nerve to go on talkin’ an’ in the same
breath refer to <i>anything</i> bein’ bored?”</p>

<p>Jawn surrendered and let Phœbe have the floor. Her
bantering request to Tyler had a serious object back of
it. This race was something more, as she well knew,
than a test of skill; it was the test of a man. Walter’s
fate was more or less in the balance, and she wished to
allay her painful anxiety by some encouraging word.
Ordinarily she wouldn’t have given a bundle of fiddle-strings
to be the winner of a dozen Lake cups; but this
race was not an ordinary race.</p>

<p>Somehow Tyler, a fine, sensitive man—sportsman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
every inch of him—caught the undercurrent of seriousness
back of the laughing face.</p>

<p>“Fagner is always dangerous in a race,” he said,
“but this time we both have our eye on Walter. He’s
a fine, natural sailor, the best ‘passenger’ I ever had.
He knows what I’m going to do before I do it and is
ready to follow up the order without wasting valuable
seconds. He has a splendid knowledge of local wind
currents—almost unnatural. I’ve often asked his
advice when I’ve been in a pinch. The only question
is, has he the control to stand the strain of a long
race? I’d like to see the boy win, Mrs. Norris——”</p>

<p>“You’re a good lad!” Mrs. Norris broke in nervously.
“Go on; tell me some more. It’ll keep me from
faintin’ away. You’re good as a drink, Mr. Tyler.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see him win,” Tyler continued, “though,
of course, I’m going to make him work. There’s nothing
more merciless in these parts than the yacht races,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Sure, we’re not askin’ for any gifts,” chirped Phœbe,
“but I thank you for the encouragin’ word, just the
same, Mr. Tyler.”</p>

<p>It was close to three o’clock, the starting time, and
Walter, with the help of Wheelen, was hoisting the
mainsail. This was hint enough for Jawn and Richard
to get on board. One searching glance around the
grounds before Richard stepped from the dock into the
<i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> gave no sign of Geraldine. As he took
his place at the port-stays and coiled his ropes he wondered
if she would come down, or if she were still marching
away across the hills with “Count.” Discouragement
seized him, a rare mood of this optimistic man,
and for several dismal minutes he lost his faith in “the
gods” who held all things in their capacious laps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>When the “get ready” gun sounded the wind was
half a gale and pointing almost directly up the Lake.
The judges were questioning the wisdom of starting,
but evidently decided to take a chance, for in a moment
or two the starting gun went off and the <i>Pluma</i>, a small
boat with a three-minute handicap, crossed the line, and
the race was on. The <i>Aurora</i> followed a half-minute
later and then came the anxious wait of two minutes
while the <i>Cohlosa</i> and the <i>Moodiks</i> jockeyed along the
edge of the starting line, each eager to get into the best
position when their signal-gun should set them free.
The <i>Cohlosa</i> and the <i>Moodiks</i> were boats of the same
sail area, so their handicap was identical. <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i>
carried a slightly larger mainsail, a matter of
inches only, but it forced her to take the “scratch”
position, a half-minute back of her two “Class A”
rivals.</p>

<p>Both the <i>Cohlosa</i> and the <i>Moodiks</i> had taken the precaution
of a single reef. Walter had not shown his
hand until close to the starting minute. His mainsail
was only half hoisted. But the moment the two “Class
A” yachts nosed across the line—Fagner, as usual,
getting the best position—he raised the sail and disclosed
three reefs. It was a type of caution that the
yachtsmen on shore did not expect of Walter Wells.</p>

<p>“Afraid of trouble?” Richard asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Walter. “Want speed. Can’t get
speed when she’s half on keel.”</p>

<p>So many exciting things were happening at once that
hardly anyone noticed the <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> as she struck
the line with the gun. The <i>Pluma</i> had dropped her sail
and her men were busy trying to keep it from ripping
away. The <i>Aurora</i> had come right about into the wind.
Her men were bailing like good fellows. Fagner and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
Tyler were beating over to the Willow Grove buoy bent
nearly level with the water.</p>

<p>The <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> stood up well and with her three
reefs was able to steer a straight course. At Willow
Grove the three boats seemed to be entangled. The
judges were on tiptoe, glasses to face, watching for
possible fouls, but no one was ready to see the <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i>
move sedately around the buoy and fly off before
the wind in the lead. In the first leg she had made
up her half-minute handicap!</p>

<p>The strength of the wind was made instantly clear to
the spectators on shore. By the recorded time Walter
had nosed around the first buoy just six seconds ahead
of Fagner, but while those six seconds were being ticked
off he was speeding up the Lake with the gale behind
him. As they all broke out in a line for the two-mile
run north the gap between the first two boats seemed
leagues.</p>

<p>Walter did not risk his spinnaker—any extra sail
was perilous in that gale—but first Fagner and then
Tyler flung their great balloon jibs out with the daring
of veterans. It was a beautiful sight, that two-mile
run; every inch of the race was in full view of the
group on shore, although it took glasses to distinguish
the yachts as they huddled together near the North
Buoy.</p>

<p>Up to within a quarter of a mile of the North Buoy
the yachts had maintained their distances, <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i>
first, Fagner a hundred yards astern and Tyler
a few feet in the rear. The <i>Pluma</i> and the <i>Aurora</i> had
swamped and were towed ashore by ready motor-boats.</p>

<p>But within a quarter of a mile of the North Buoy
the wind suddenly slackened. Then the spinnakers
told. In the swift changes that occur in yacht races<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
of this sort the positions seemed instantly to change.
Again the three boats massed at the buoy, but this time
the <i>Cohlosa</i> came about first, followed by the <i>Moodiks</i>.
The <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> was last.</p>

<p>Anyone can sail before the wind. The test of seamanship
is in the cleverness of the tacking, and that
test was now on. Tyler shot off to the east and, as
everyone knew, Fagner did the opposite. Fagner’s
theory seemed to be that if you get an advantage of a
slant of the wind it is better to have the other fellow in
some other part of the Lake. Walter followed Tyler,
but broke his tack early; so the three boats were soon in
widely scattered portions of the Lake. As they crossed
and recrossed each other’s paths it was impossible to
tell which was in the lead. The long beat down the
Lake was therefore tremendously exciting to the partisans
on shore, each group seeing its own the victor.</p>

<p>Characteristic of winds in this hilly country the
breeze, still moderately stiff but no longer the fierce gale
of the beginning, shifted to the southeast. Each skipper
was thoroughly aware of the change, of course, but
none, perhaps, were so mindful of the advantages of
changing the original plans as Walter. In the middle
of the Lake he suddenly let out his reefs and came about.
He was now pointing almost directly to the cove at
Electric Park just above Alley’s Inn; and into this
cove he slid until he was lost to the group on the high
ground at the starting point. Fagner and Tyler were
beating down to the starting buoy from the east, but it
was soon obvious that each would have to take one
more tack, although they “pointed” courageously; but
as they put about reluctantly for one more try, the
<i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> nosed along the shore and shot past
Alley’s Inn, crossed the starting line and swung out for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
a long tack to Willow Grove. Walter had been
pointing straight into the southeast wind, seemingly
an impossible feat. According to all the rules his
mainsail and jib should have been flapping uselessly,
but, instead, they had been comfortably filled. A
back-current from the western hills had carried him
forward.</p>

<p>It was three minutes before Fagner crossed the line
and a minute more before Tyler finished the first leg.
By that time Walter had rounded the Willow Grove
buoy and was scudding up the Lake with the southeaster
back of him. It was then that he flung out his
spinnaker.</p>

<p>To the surprise of everyone he did not aim directly
for the North Buoy, but crowded far to the east. In an
uncanny way he had guessed that the freakish wind
would soon shift to the east and then to the northeast.
And so it did. He crossed the Lake with the wind still
at his back and came about the North Buoy in time to
get the new shift to northeast. His spinnaker was still
ballooning beautifully as he came down to finish the
second leg, while Fagner and Tyler were beating up in
long tacks.</p>

<p>The wind had blown him up the Lake and obligingly
had turned around to blow him down again. And while
he had gone north in a straight line his competitors for
the cup had been compelled to zigzag across the Lake,
five times his distance.</p>

<p>Luck had been with Walter, of course, but at the
same time he had been knowing enough to take advantage
of his special knowledge of the ways of the wind.
In his present position nothing short of a calm could
have taken the race from him, and the northeaster that
began to blow—it was the old storm, which had by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
this time veered to an opposite quarter—gave no signs
of letting up.</p>

<p>The end came rapidly. When Walter crossed the
finish line a winner of the first of the three races for the
cup, the <i>Moodiks</i> and the <i>Cohlosa</i> had not yet reached
the North Buoy on the final leg.</p>

<p>It was as the <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> passed Alley’s Inn a
winner and sped on down the Lake towards Bluff Point
and “home” that Richard caught sight of “Count”
stretched out on the lawn and saw beside him a figure
in grey standing silhouetted against the trees; then he
knew that Jerry had been present to see at least the
glorious finish. She had a pair of field-glasses to her
eyes, and as he became conscious of the fact that she
was following the fast retreating yacht his ears burned
and the blood flushed his neck and forehead. It was
fortunate at that moment that the <i>Sago-ye-wat-ha</i> had
no urgent need of her “stay” tender!</p>

<p>Walter bore his victory very grimly. He smiled
faintly towards the shore as the horns tooted and the
motor whistles blew and he listened attentively to the
chorus of exciting congratulations from his crew and
from the crowd on the end of the dock and from
unknown persons scooting by in motor-boats, but he
said nothing. His eye was on Bluff Point and his mind
seemed to be busy calculating if this sweeping northeaster
would last long enough to carry him home.</p>

<p>The other members of the crew would have preferred
to stay and bask in the victory. It would be pleasant
to anchor off the Inn and watch the veterans, <i>Moodiks</i>
and <i>Cohlosa</i>, fight it out for second place. But Walter
said “No,” and no one pressed him. The victory was
his entirely, they realized, and in this happy hour the
captain’s wishes would be their law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>On his way home Richard spent his time watching
the boy’s face. In the past month Walter seemed to
have grown several steps nearer to manhood; certainly
as he held the tiller snug under his left arm and trimmed
the mainsheet with his right hand he looked miles removed
from the helpless creature of the S.S. <i>Victoria</i>.
The “cure” had made great progress; so great, indeed,
that Richard was quite puffed up with pride of this
secret victory of his which outclassed the winning of a
mere yacht race.</p>

<p>He wished to hear him talk, to see how he carried
himself in this unique experience of having done something
worthy of public commendation.</p>

<p>“If that wind-pocket is always off shore when a
southeaster blows,” he began, “how is it that the other
skippers don’t know of it?”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t always there,” said Walter; but he did not
grin sheepishly, as he might have done several weeks
ago.</p>

<p>“Oh!... Weren’t you sure it was there to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, not sure; jes’ took a chance. Things looked
right.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you had missed your guess?”</p>

<p>“We’d ’a’ lost.”</p>

<p>“Were you prepared to lose?”</p>

<p>“Sure! This ain’t the on’y race! Best out o’ five.”</p>

<p>The races were scheduled one each week until one
boat had taken three wins, but Richard knew that his
work with Walter was over. There was no excuse he
would offer to stay longer at “Red Jacket,” for there
would be volunteers a-plenty to tend port-stays, and,
evidently, Walter had “found himself.” Richard’s
feelings were a complex of disappointment and joy.
The new life in New York was making a vigorous call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
upon him. His wander-years were over, and, as easily
as season slips into season, he was turning directly about
and facing with high curiosity the next stage when he
would take up his father’s work as man of many affairs.</p>

<p>Wheelen put off in his motor-boat, and Walter left as
soon as everything was stowed away, but Jawn and
Richard sat in the shade of the Lombardy poplars and
enjoyed the fine August evening. Their talk was
interrupted by a crash of some falling object in Phœbe’s
cottage. A trifling accident, probably. They had
heard Phœbe’s voice when Walter entered. Of course
she had driven down with the Wells or probably had
come down in the trolley and, naturally, would have
made the distance in much less time than it took the
yacht to round Bluff Point and beat up to the dock.</p>

<p>Voices in anger and another crash of furniture
brought the two men to their feet. Before they had
taken a dozen steps they saw Walter rush out and reach
up to the little shelf where the whisky had rested
untouched since early spring. Phœbe followed instantly;
she was talking to him soothingly, although
the men noticed that she had unhooked Seth’s whip;
but Walter was shrill and defiant. When Jerry, too,
emerged from the house the men dropped into a walk
and entered upon the scene with seeming calmness.</p>

<p>Jerry stood away from the boy, but Phœbe was not
afraid of him.</p>

<p>“You said y’d marry me!” Walter shouted hoarsely
and gripped the whisky. “You said——”</p>

<p>“No, Walter,” Phœbe pursued him calmly. “I said
I would think about it. An’ I <i>am</i> thinkin’ about it, my
boy.”</p>

<p>“Y’r puttin’ me off, an’ puttin’ me off!” he complained
harshly. “An’ I won’t stan’ it, d’ye hear?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
Won’t stan’ it! Gotta know some time ’r other.
Gotta know <i>now</i>!”</p>

<p>“Listen to the lad!” Phœbe was purring cheerily.
“He isn’t satisfied to win a boat race, but he must win
a woman all in the same day.” Walter tossed his head
defiantly and raised the bottle. “<i>If you so much as lift
that stuff to your lips, young man</i>,” she cried suddenly,
so suddenly as to upset a considerable portion of it on
her porch; “<i>if ye even touch it</i>,” she cried, “I’ll not only
never marry you but I’ll beat you with this whip till
you cry for mercy!” Then when he dropped his arm
she laughed softly—burbled, that is!—and coaxed him
again. “How do I know I won’t marry you, lad?
You must give me time, now. It’s a long while to be
together as man an’ wife—ah!” she sighed comically—“it’s
that sentimental I am I can’t say the words
without it sendin’ me all a-flutter!... Come in,
Walter; put that stuff up—no, don’t throw it away!
Put it back where you got it. I want you to have it
right before you, to make sure you’ve got really done
with it. An’ by the same token, me lad, I’ll just hang
me little whip up here beside it, to keep it company
like!” Her laugh took all the sting out of that remark,
but it did not conceal the determination back of the
words.</p>

<p>The men would have slipped off, but Phœbe invited
them to stay. And she invited them also to help her
prepare a fitting supper to celebrate the victory. In a
few moments her chatter and laughter filled all the scene
and blotted out the ugly episode. And every now and
then she would give Walter little pats as she passed him—he
made no effort to help with the “party”—and
she would whisper startling little things in his ear and
set him grinning in spite of himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>And Jerry? She was still in her walking suit of grey
corduroy, and her mood was somewhat of that sombre
colour, but the victory of Walter’s boat and the shock
made by Walter’s revelations of his relations with Phœbe
had served to put a slight glow of warmth into her
speech. To Richard she conversed frankly, but with
an air of keeping something back.</p>

<p>Later in the evening when in the clatter of voices he
managed to tell her that he would go to New York on
the morrow, her eyes opened very wide, but she said
nothing.</p>

<p>“It is for good,” he tried to smile.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do there?” she asked
indifferently.</p>

<p>“Take up my father’s work, if I am able.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather inconsistent, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that one does honestly is inconsistent,” he
replied firmly. “I never believed I could do it; but the
inward voice calls very loud just now, and I am eager
to try myself in this new experience.”</p>

<p>“We shall miss you,” she tried to tell him in a tone
of polite sincerity, and she bravely declined to avoid
looking at him. Their eyes met squarely. It was a
dangerous moment, but she managed it with dramatic
success; so much so that while his own eyes had the
appearance of a pathetic dog waiting for his biscuit,
hers resembled nothing so much as the round staring
optics of those old-fashioned French dolls.</p>

<p>As abruptly as Phœbe had invited everyone to stay
and sup with her, she invited everyone to leave. She
wished to be alone, she said, to gather her scattered
wits. Walter was expressly included in the notice of
eviction, but he stubbornly remained behind.</p>

<p>Phœbe affected not to observe him as she cleared up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
briskly, humming as she went in and out doors, as she
brushed crumbs, or moved chairs and benches about.
Walter watched her hungrily, but his bravado was gone;
he glanced at her now and then almost timidly, fearing,
somehow, her very physical strength and the atmosphere
she carried of confidence, determination, will—qualities
he vaguely envied in her.</p>

<p>“Well, Walter,” she turned to him at length, as if
at last she had gathered those scattered wits and had
them concentrated on a thing to do. “Well, Walter,
we have a few matters to settle, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>Walter tried to answer, but speech was not quite
possible for him. He was keen enough to sense disaster
in her tone, and knew not how to meet it with words.</p>

<p>“Did I ever say I would marry you?” she went at
him with brisk directness.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered doggedly.</p>

<p>“Think, boy,” swiftly she softened her tone.
“Wasn’t it you who were always at me, and didn’t I
always tell you that I wouldn’t even talk about it?
Boy! Boy!” She came near him and mothered him
with her smile. “Wasn’t it always you? Always just
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he managed huskily.</p>

<p>“I’m six years older than you——” she began, but
he interrupted fiercely.</p>

<p>“That makes no difference!” he cried. “No difference
at all!”</p>

<p>“If it were only that, boy,” she continued. “But I
am more than six years older, Walter; I am ages older.
I have lived ... lived——” she stopped and let her
eyes rove about the room. “Years! What are
years!” She threw up her hands. “Twenty-eight?
I’m nearer a hundred and twenty-eight! Life has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
burned me out, and all the faster because before the
world I am too proud to own to it; in experience, boy,
I am an old woman.”</p>

<p>He stopped her and told her of her youth and
her beauty and her compelling loveliness. His voice
trembled, but he forced himself through a strong manly
speech.</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Phœbe. “Boy! Boy!” she crooned,
“it’s yourself you’re comin’ to now! Now you’re talkin’
like a man! Talkin’ like a man, you are! And let
me talk to you like a woman. Maybe I didn’t say I
would marry you, but I was ready to—if I was forced
to it——”</p>

<p>“Forced!” he exclaimed. “What d’ y’ mean?”</p>

<p>“Just that—forced.” Her voice was low now, and
solemn. “If there had been no other way out, no other
way to save you from yourself, I’d have done it. You
and your mother and Jerry are all I have, and what
would I not do for them? I would have done it; but
it would have been like taking in some hunted creature
that everybody had given up. And that is pity,
Walter; just pity.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care what you call it,” he said.</p>

<p>“Pity is all right for stray dogs, Walter. If you
had been just a crippled little puppy—well, I could
have shared everything with you. But to marry, to
live together—I couldn’t. I thought I could, but now
I see that I never could. I am not big enough for that.”</p>

<p>He stood up and began to summon his strength to
combat her, but she waved him down.</p>

<p>“Listen,” she said. “Listen until I finish....
Boy, it wouldn’t work. We’re not the mates for each
other. No! No! We’re not, I tell you.”</p>

<p>Then he broke forth in speeches that were mixtures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
of strength and weakness. He demanded his rights;
he begged her to be kind; he threatened; he pointed
out the misery she was planning for him.</p>

<p>“And are you thinkin’ of my misery?” she asked, so
plaintively as to arrest him.</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes—just me. Do you fancy for a moment that
it wouldn’t be misery for me? I pity you, and I care
for you so much that my heart aches for you; I would
give years of my life to see you grow into a strong
dependable man, but I don’t love you.... Don’t
speak yet; let me speak. I will tell you something
that nobody else knows. In my bedroom is a tiny
closet which nobody opens but me; and when it is
opened it is an altar, with candles, and a sweet, old,
crooked image of Saint Francis which belonged to my
mother; Saint Francis who loved the birds and the
souls of all dumb things. And I fool everybody, everybody
but you; for I pray before my little altar—and
I have oh! such faith! But nobody else knows that;
nobody but you and me now. How I fool them all
with my bad tongue!... And when I pray I pray
for you. I pray that the good in you shall grow and
grow and grow. And my prayer is answered daily!
And I pray that the good Saint Francis shall spread
out his arms and take you up and shield you from all
bitterness and wrong thinking. ‘Dear God,’ I say,
‘make my boy to see; reach out the hand to his
stumbling feet; make my boy to see.’”</p>

<p>He tried to tell her something, but he could not
speak. The pity in her voice, her swimming eyes, and
the picture she conjured before him of the trustful
suppliant bowed below her little candles—it was too
much; it engulfed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>Soon she went on. “I don’t love you and you would
find it out; and then—why, Walter, in the next ten
years you will be still a youth, a youth demanding
youth; while I will be forty and faded out. Oh, yes,
I will! I know my kind. They are either very young
or very old—no middle years at all. I will grow
suddenly old—and it would come all the quicker if
every day I should suffer.”</p>

<p>He told her defiantly that she would not suffer.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I should,” she nodded her head wisely.
“For you, Walter, it might mean a little happiness,
but for me it would be daily and hourly pain. I know.
You look at the present, but I see the years and years
ahead. No, boy; you must grow strong as you have
been growing. You must throw off the evil that has
gripped you. And then, some day when you have
become a man among men, love will come to you, and
you and she will ... will go off together ... as ... as
once ... I thought I was going.”</p>

<p>Softly she slipped into a chair and buried her face in
her hands, and the quiet tears came.</p>

<p>After a painful moment or two Phœbe controlled her
voice, but she did not look up as she spoke, nor take
her hands away from her face.</p>

<p>“I haven’t told you all, Walter,” she said. “I have
been trying not to say it ... but I must tell you. I
have prayed that if it must be, I would take you and
give my life to you.... And I will.”</p>

<p>“You will?” he asked incredulously, and struggled
to grasp the meaning of her startling suggestion.</p>

<p>“I will if it is God’s will.... He will tell me....
Oh, I have great faith, boy. He will tell me in a very
simple way. I offer all my life to you as I meant to do
when you came here that night a year ago, and I got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
you on your feet and you promised to try. And you
have tried, boy; I’m proud of the way you have tried!...
I promised God then that if He willed it I would
take you and save your soul.... He will tell me; it
will be when you say again that you want me ... that
you still want me to do it.”</p>

<p>“When I say I——” he began, but found no need
to finish.</p>

<p>Walter saw all too clearly what she meant. She
nodded, but did not remove her hands from her face.
She seemed to be waiting tremulously for the verdict
from on high.</p>

<p>If he still insisted that he wanted her, if his mind
was blind to the sacrifice, then he would indeed need
her; if he thought enough of her not to drag her down
with him, then there was the spark of a man in him,
and he would not need her. And as he spoke, so would
God speak.</p>

<p>For an irresolute moment or two Walter stood
watching her; then he swore a savage sort of oath and
cried out that he would make her keep her word; and
then he fled out of the house, as if fearful of himself.
But the incoherencies had gone from his speech. He
was a beaten man, but, Phœbe exulted as she dabbed
at her eyes, he was a man! It was a bitter hour for
him, but he was struggling now, not as a weakling,
petulant and unreasonable, but as a man battling with
grief. So in spite of her tears there was a smile on her
face as she looked after him. She listened, and knew
his step on the uneven planks of the dock. Then she
heard the “plump” of his plunge into the tender,
which gave her a horrid second of terror until the
powerful strokes of oars creaking fainter and fainter
told her that he was rowing out into the calm Lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>She went to the window and watched his black
silhouette. The moon was just beginning to mount.</p>

<p>“It’s the Lake that we go to in our little troubles,”
she murmured. “The dear old mother of a
Lake!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>PROUD MISS PIDDIWIT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the “party” broke up Jerry deliberately
walked up the hill with Richard, and suggested, in the
tone of the perfect hostess, that as this would be their
last evening together for some time they might draw
up chairs and sit under the spell of “Da” and
“Waga.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about your new work,” she suggested. It
was as an elderly lady might ask a very recent freshman
about his studies in the new college. Nevertheless, he
told her.</p>

<p>Somehow he felt himself on the defensive. The
champion of egoism was about to shift square about
and become altruist; for he made no attempt to conceal
that his interest in taking up the complicated affairs of
big business was prompted not by the wish of making
a large fortune larger, but solely because of the conviction
growing upon him that his responsibilities to
others overshadowed the desires of self.</p>

<p>“Suddenly my need of others and their need of me
has been made clear to me,” he explained quietly. “I
can no longer fare alone.... I used to be completely
self-sustaining; I had no desires that I could not
supply, for I was careful to keep my wants within my
powers to satisfy them; I had need for no one, and
therefore I never felt the call of co-operation. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
the moment that a man finds his happiness gripped
by another——” he hesitated, for it was a difficult
matter to phrase—“the moment the needs of his spirit
call to the spirit of another, then he sees how all are
bound together, dependent one upon another.... I
express the thought badly; I doubt if I can truly reason
out the change that has come over me, but its results
are clear—I go to my appointed task, a little late, to
be sure, but at last with clear vision of what that
appointed task is.... My caterpillar-views,” he
laughed softly, “look very odd now; perhaps I have
broken my predestined chrysalis ... or perhaps it is
the American father speaking in me at last. At any
rate, my wander-years are over. I have been an
English aristocrat, I find, in spite of my poverty—they
are the greatest of natural loafers; ‘barbarians,’
somebody called them, and rightly. The English are
most excellent loafers, exquisites at it. The American
in me, I feel, is going to be no loafer; I can sense him
pulling at me and driving me at service.... And I
am still consistent with myself,” he talked to fill in
the empty spaces; she did not seem inclined to help
much; “for I am still honest, and, you know, I never
agreed to be more than that.”</p>

<p>The night was pleasantly mild. A misshapen moon
rose slowly over the Lake and began to light up hill
and valley. No hint of the freakish weather of the
afternoon was suggested by this warm summer evening;
the old earth hummed with its crickets and frogs, and
rustled its leaves lazily as if pretending that it had
never been unruly in its life. It was too fine to go
indoors, the two young persons agreed.</p>

<p>Topics of conversation grew uncomfortably scarce
until Richard remembered Phœbe. What had she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
meant by her attitude towards Walter? Surely she did
not intend to marry the boy, yet if ever mortal man was
encouraged by woman that chap was Walter. And if
she did not intend seriously to live up to her implied
promise, wouldn’t it be dangerous to lead him on?</p>

<p>Jerry sprang eagerly into the welcome topic. “I
haven’t had such a shock since——” she could not think
of a concrete comparison, at least none that she cared
to mention in this company—“well, since ever so long.
Isn’t it unbelievable?”</p>

<p>“I think it is splendid!” he spoke warmly. “If she
cares for him in the right way—and I have faith that
she does—it will be one of the best arrangements that
could be made.”</p>

<p>“Cares for him?” repeated Jerry. “How could
she!”</p>

<p>“It is just one more beautiful mystery,” he said
quietly. “Why do you insist upon thinking your own
view-point is the whole truth?”</p>

<p>There was not the slightest suggestion of offence in
his question. He seemed to be addressing not Jerry
in particular, but the whole human species.</p>

<p>“But she doesn’t really care for him,” Jerry
protested, “in the—the—way you mean, you know.”</p>

<p>“How can you be sure?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she was very frank to me. She said she
believed she was too strong-minded ever to be enslaved
by a man. She made delicious fun of—of—love, and
all that sort of nonsense. She said that what she
wanted was devotion, deference—like du Barry and
Madame Maintenon. She claims that if a woman wants
nothing from a man she’ll get everything she wants.
Walter, she said, is the only man whom she can
guarantee to stay devoted for life. Oh, she was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
frank, and also very droll. I tried my best to be
serious, but she had me laughing half the time.”</p>

<p>“And so she fooled you, did she?” he asked.</p>

<p>Jerry protested, but he insisted that Phœbe was
choosing her mate and that all her clever chatter was
disguise.</p>

<p>“But she fooled me, too,” he laughed. “She let me
tell her all my theories about the reclamation of Walter.
Jove! I thought climbing mastheads after fouled peak
halyards was his trouble, but all the while it was a
woman he was climbing after! A woman is his
‘primary,’ after all. Well! well! She is wonderful.
I envy Walter.”</p>

<p>The topic was a good one. It had made Jerry
forget her stilted hostess manner. And after she had
once thawed it was difficult, with that moon mounting
gloriously, to freeze up again.</p>

<p>Richard was quick to follow up with another helpful
topic—Jawn as a sailor lad. He retailed the palaver
that Jawn had kept going throughout the whole race.
He had made limericks on every part of the ship’s tackle
and on his rival yachtsmen, and he had punned almost
to the limit of endurance. Some of the best ones
Richard culled and repeated. They were too local to
be of general interest, but that made their humour all
the keener to a native. Again and again Jerry found
herself limp with merriment, although deep within,
something reproached her for unbending. But she was
too weary to resist; she had spent a bad night and she
had been tramping over the hills since sunrise.</p>

<p>Never mind! she told herself; let not the confident
man before her plume himself on graciousness. A
woman may smile and smile and be a—well, not exactly
a villain, but as obstinate and unalterable as the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
of villains. On that point she had no misgivings; the
long meditations on the hills with “Count” had cleared
her mind of every doubt and told her what she had to
do. It would be silly—now that it was all decided
for ever—to stand aloof like proud Miss Piddiwit.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Proud Miss Piddiwit, there she goes.</div>
<div class="verse">What is she proud of? Nobody knows!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Miss Piddiwit was an unfortunate figure of speech.
Some imp of her mind, perhaps, some mischievous Puck
of that unknown subliminal region it was who hoisted
that forgotten picture of the old “Mother Goose”
book up out of the mental depths and let it strut before
her. Miss Piddiwit bore her head aloft at a perilous
angle, and her little heels clicked on the pavement in
staccato rhythm with the couplet, which the aforesaid
subliminal imp took delight in chanting.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Proud Miss Piddiwit, there she goes.</div>
<div class="verse">What is she proud of? Nobody knows!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Let’s walk,” she started up suddenly. “This night
is too wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Good!” he agreed.</p>

<p>They dropped down the lawn, passed the summer-house
without seeming to notice it at all, and took the
State Road which leads north to Penn Yan.</p>

<p>“You are your mother’s daughter,” he announced
abruptly. He spoke as if it were the summing-up of a
train of thinking.</p>

<p>“Naturally,” she said.</p>

<p>They walked on for several seconds without speaking.</p>

<p>“You do not ask why,” said Richard.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I know why.”</p>

<p>The “imp” had been forcing her to keep step with
the Piddiwit jingle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>“But it would help the conversation if you would ask
questions.”</p>

<p>“Is conversation necessary?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he laughed. “What would distinguish us
from the rest of the animal kingdom if we didn’t talk!
Yes,” he went on, “conversation is necessary. Unless
you run away I’m going to talk.... It may be our
last conversation together—although I won’t believe
that——”</p>

<p>“How can you be sure, Mr. Richard?”</p>

<p>Into this question she tried to throw a satiric
imitation of his question to her on the night of his
arrival in Penn Yan, the night when she had protested
that she at least would never make eyes at him; but,
man-like, he had not the mind to catch such subtleties.
Still, the remark gave her a little elation and put her
in good spirits. She would show this young man!</p>

<p>“As you know,” he replied, “I am sure of nothing.
That discourages some people, but it makes me continually
full of hope. Micawber, you know, was
kept radiantly alive by it.... Yesterday I asked you
to marry me——”</p>

<p>“Please!” she interrupted, and quickened her pace.</p>

<p>“Of course I won’t speak if it worries you,” he said
contritely enough; “but it is a pity, I think, not to
face every situation fairly. And I do so want to face
this one.”</p>

<p>She slowed up and thought the matter over carefully.
Why shouldn’t he talk if he cared to? The answer
was, why, indeed!</p>

<p>“Very well,” she summoned her most casual tones;
“face it; only—don’t expect me to help much.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he broke in quickly, “I’m not so inexperienced
as to believe anyone can argue away an emotion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
Either you like me—in the way I mean, you know—or
you don’t. That’s under neither your control nor
mine. Words won’t mend anything there. But words
may help to clear up misunderstanding.... You are
sure this won’t worry you?”</p>

<p>“Why should it?”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” he agreed grimly; “why should it?...
Very well....” But he said nothing more.</p>

<p>She looked up at him quickly.</p>

<p>“Well?” he looked down earnestly.</p>

<p>“You have never been sulky with me,” she explained.
“Jawn says you go for weeks without speaking to
anyone, and Phœbe said you went perfectly dumb on
her porch one afternoon. I was just wondering if it
were my turn at last.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I don’t feel that way at all! That’s one
of the signs that makes me sure that you—you are
... I can’t get hold of the right words, that’s all.
And it isn’t that, either. I’ve got the right words,
bundles of them! But I’m afraid if I start in to pour
them forth at you—if I start to tell you how much I—I—care
about you—you’ll take fright and also take this
trolley home. So to make sure I’ll wait till it passes.
Thank goodness they run only two cars on this line—or
is it the same one going frantically back and forth?”</p>

<p>They stepped aside to avoid the lights of the car.
Somehow, both felt the necessity of keeping clear of
publicity.</p>

<p>“I won’t have you maligning the institutions of my
country,” she replied, with a touch of the old-time
cheeriness. “We are not a restless people moving to
and fro over the face of the earth and in subways
seeking whom we may devour. Let me inform you,
Mr. Richard Richard, that in the busy summer season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
we run <i>both</i> cars. If you were a woman you would not
make the mistake of thinking them only one, for then
you would have noticed that while each conductor is
handsome, one is light and the other dark.”</p>

<p>“Like beer,” he joked.</p>

<p>“In these parts you should say, like port and
champagne,” she corrected. “This is a wine country,
and we are famous for our champagne. But don’t you
think we should turn back? That is the last car down,
and, as you suggest, I ought to keep within running
distance of home. But I interrupted your beautiful
speech. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>She was quite pleased with herself. At first she
feared that she might not be able to carry off her part
of the conversation without showing suspicious excitement;
but here she was actually joking! She was
proud of her control, was this Miss Piddiwit!</p>

<p>Lamely at first and then, as he ceased to pick his
words, with surer touch Richard proceeded with his
“beautiful speech.” No smart retorts came to her aid;
no retorts at all, indeed, for the man was sweeping
her off her secured moorings—had she not spent half
the night and the whole of the morning in steeling her
will to oppose just this?—and he was driving her into
a horrid state of weak nervousness. Richard Richard
had studied frankness and soul analysis like a research
student, and his speech carried with it an ozonic
atmosphere of truth. Suddenly he came to an end.</p>

<p>Instead of crushing him with any of the carefully
selected phrases which she had rehearsed in her
morning tramp with “Count” she filled in the silence
with a question that was almost a cry.</p>

<p>“How do you know it will last?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know it at all,” he replied with amazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
frankness. “Every lover lies, of course, or is deceived,
which amounts to the same thing. Affection usually
does not last. The evidence of the world is before us;
why not face it? How can I guarantee the future?
I cannot. I know only my consuming faith that what
has begun here so honestly and so free from taint is
bound to have eternal meaning. Perhaps that is
nature’s clever illusion; but I cannot believe it. It
may not last, but what of that? Events are in the
hands of the gods; yet what greater joy than staking all
on the risks of life? Faith is the thing. And God knows
I have faith—the faith that passeth understanding.”</p>

<p>She would have more specific reasons. He gave
them to her. First, he talked!</p>

<p>“You say I never sulk with you,” he argued. “It
isn’t really sulking at all. Of course, I know you were
only joking; but it is worse than boorish petulance,
it is an absolute dumbness, an inability to speak. In
these past weeks I seem to have broken from my bonds,
and I believe it is you who have set me free. They say
that Lewis Carroll had the same sort of infirmity except
in the presence of his beloved children, and I can well
understand how he must have suffered and how he had
to get used to faring it alone. For my shyness I have
paid a great penalty; I have had no playfellows as a
child—I never got really acquainted with my own
mother. Governesses and tutors used to shirk their
job and let me alone. If I hadn’t early learned to
read and to like books, I suppose I should have grown
up an ignoramus to boot! And you—why, look how
I am talking!</p>

<p>“Now for reason number two. For the first time
in my life I want to take my father’s money and use it.
You’ve made me want to do that. You have filled me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
with strange worldly ambitions. I want to take my
place with other men and bear my share of the burden;
and I want to buy you all sorts of things. I have a
savage desire to clothe you and feed you and fix up
your nest. And I have the wildest visions of a lot of
kiddies——”</p>

<p>She almost shot ahead of him.</p>

<p>“Don’t run away,” he called, and caught up with
her. “You’re a grown-up woman, and I’m so old
that it frightens me. Why in the name of all the holy
mysteries at once should we scare off at the thought of
children? Woman, it is the most glorious thought in
all creation! And they must be clothed,” he went on,
“and sent to school and to college and taken to Europe
and ‘brought out’ and given a bang-up start in life.
And all that takes money, heaps of it. We’ve just <i>got</i>
to have money, woman; don’t you see that?”</p>

<p>She saw that—better than he did, perhaps—but
she could not trust herself to take up that point in
the debate. Fortunately at this moment she caught
through the trees a clear light shining far below in
Phœbe Norris’s cottage.</p>

<p>“I wonder what Phœbe is doing up at this hour?”
she turned the subject. “She usually goes to bed with
her Orpingtons.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we find out?” he challenged her.</p>

<p>The returning trolley was grinding up the hill from
Branchport and would soon expose them in the road.
If the conductors, “Port” or “Champagne,” ever
caught a good glimpse of her, the news would spread
quickly over Yates county.</p>

<p>“All right,” she agreed, and they struck down the
steep road just as the headlight from the car flashed up
over the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>He talked eloquently all the way down, but while
she listened she used the time to summon her scattered
forces and get her mental house in order. It had been
a wild delight to let him fight down her will, but she
was the daughter of her mother and no weakling.</p>

<p>One thing she was sure of, and it made her glad
beyond words to express: his offer of marriage had not
been prompted by charity. He was in earnest, terribly
in earnest; but also he was, as usual, selfish. She was
hearing his point of view, but he showed with every
word that he had no conception of hers.</p>

<p>The world would say, when its scandal-loving ear had
taken in all the facts, that Geraldine Wells, bankrupt,
who had been brazenly living for several years on the
savings of negro servants, had deliberately forced herself
upon a rich young man—a notoriously rich young
man, at that—had inveigled him into her home and
had trapped him into making an offer of marriage. A
Wells would never permit a situation like that!</p>

<p>Proud Miss Piddiwit!</p>

<p>And how the newspapers would seize the theme!
Their searchlight would flare into every nook; nothing
would prevent their discovery of the incognito and the
“romance”; the latter, she knew, would be a particularly
tempting morsel. They make no distinction
between the great and the notorious, but play each
impartially to the tune of their scareheads. Reporters
would come by special train; even George Alexander
would be interviewed! Just because a father had had
a genius for accumulation an innocent second generation
must suffer publicity. If Richard Richard had
only been a nobody! But he was not; he was by very
birth notorious.</p>

<p>She conjured up headlines that even a hardened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
city editor would not have sanctioned. The cable
would carry the “news” to Europe. Their engagement
would be one long nightmare of publicity; the
marriage would be a vulgarian’s holiday. And then
she remembered the columnist and the cartoonist.
The thought was revolting.</p>

<p>But she drifted, nevertheless, with the compelling
events of the night. To-morrow with its harsh
necessities would come in due time, and to-morrow
and to-morrow.</p>

<p>She would do well to linger as long as possible in the
exhilarating illusion of the moment. Even if it were
all to be eventually cancelled and forgotten, it was
delightfully thrilling to have this strong man by her
side making most complimentary speeches. His earnestness
was very soothing to her pride; one might as
well steep as long as possible in the experience.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile, out on the Lake, Walter had been
struggling with his remnant of a soul, and had found
some touch of that peace which comes to the Lake
people, to all people who look out daily on vast
stretches of water. It was peace, but it was tinged
with tragic sorrow, and thereby, and only thereby, it
was worthy and beyond price.</p>

<p>While Jerry and Richard were still strolling along
the Penn Yan road, Walter was again at Phœbe’s door.
She had prepared herself for bed when his knock came;
so she slipped on a kimono and came to the door
wondering. When she saw his stern face, she stepped
back quickly, and called on her Saint Francis, as a
child in great fear might cry to the mother.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of me any more, Phœbe,” he
spoke huskily but firmly. “I’ve been thinkin’ things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
out.... You’re right.... It wouldn’t do.... It
wouldn’t do—for you.... I guess ... I guess,” he
faltered; “I guess this is where I get up or fall back
again——”</p>

<p>“But you won’t, boy!” she exulted. “You won’t!
You will stand up and fight for yourself, and you will
fight for me, and be the man I’ll be proud of all my
life. All my life, boy.... For me, boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he choked, but stood even a shade more
erect. “For you, Phœbe.”</p>

<p>And then he strode away in the moonlight.</p>

<p>And Phœbe watched him from the doorway, and
cried little chirping words to herself; and a sweeping
happiness seized her, touched with a vague regret; and
some of it was for the victory she had won; and some
of it was for the pity of it all; and some of it was for
the long, empty years of her own life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As Jerry and Richard neared the cottage they
quieted their step and moved stealthily to the window
at the side. Phœbe was stretched at length in a commodious
leather chair. She was in a great blue kimono
and her hands were clasped behind her neck, her bared
arms extending languorously on either side. Her glorious
red hair was smoothed back and it dropped in two
long loose braids in front. Her big blue eyes were wide,
and they focussed on some vast distance. She looked
for all the world like some splendid fearless child.</p>

<p>As they gazed upon the picture the two eavesdroppers
felt suddenly like culprits; so they walked noisily
around the porch to the front and tapped on the door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” Phœbe called, but moved not an inch.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she chuckled wisely, and scrutinized them
from her deep chair. “Gallivantin’, as usual, eh?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
On her face was not the slightest trace of the experience
of the night; and her voice suggested never a
sorrow. To the end of her days Phœbe Norris, and all
her kind, would practise concealment of their suffering
and of their virtues, reserving full confession to one
only, and that one must be a mate proved by fire!</p>

<p>Only Richard and Phœbe knew the full significance
of the accusation of “gallivanting.” He remembered
her etymology, “From ‘galli,’ ‘a woman,’ and ‘vantin’,’
‘wantin’ ’em bad.’” So he nodded his head and
confessed.</p>

<p>“Absolutely guilty in the highest degree,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>ho!</i>” she exclaimed, and looked first at one
and then at the other. “Oh, <i>ho!</i>” she repeated very
sagely. “Is that the way the wind’s a-blowin’!”</p>

<p>She acted as if the idea had never struck her before,
but she so charged the atmosphere with accusation that
Richard grew crimson and Jerry stiffened into angry
opposition.</p>

<p>“There’s no wind at all, Phœbe,” Jerry blurted.
“Don’t be silly!”</p>

<p>“I’m not accusin’ myself of bein’ silly,” she remarked
quietly. “Oh, well!” she saw that she was making
them both self-conscious; “perhaps the breeze has died
down temporarily. It does in these parts, Richard,”
she turned to him learnedly. “The Keuka winds are
that tricky, now! One minute they’re roarin’ as if the
seven chained devils were loose an’ after ’em—as you
might have noticed this afternoon—first blowin’ one
way and then the other; an’ before you can pull your
cap over your ears and button up the top button of
your coat, they’re gone, and the Lake is as smooth as
you see it to-night. But look out!” she cautioned, with
a mischievous smile twinkling about her eyes, “look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
out! There’s apt to be an ugly squall any minute.
You never can be sure. Just look at that Lake now!”
she pointed out of the long windows. The moon had
lighted up its glassy surface; there was not a wrinkle
on it. “Don’t it look innocent and child-like, now?
An’ who would think that it could ever rise up and
roil with passion?”</p>

<p>Her elaborate figure of speech—a very obvious
parable—did not help matters. It was just clever
enough to give Jerry a vivid picture of reality and to
cause her to strengthen her obstinate resolution. But
except for an extra look of firmness she disclosed
nothing as she turned the subject.</p>

<p>“We peeked in the window as we passed by, Phœbe,”
Jerry confessed. “You looked adorably contented. A
penny for your thoughts.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” Phœbe gave a satisfied purr. “An’ why
shouldn’t I be contented? It isn’t every lone widow
that has two suitors in one day.”</p>

<p>“Two!”</p>

<p>They both spoke together.</p>

<p>“It isn’t very complimentary to show such astonishment,”
remarked Phœbe. “I’ve me charms yet, I
fancy. Yes, two. One comes along, a sea-farin’ man,
and says, ‘Choose!’ says he; ‘choose between me and
a quart of bad whisky,’ says he. It was a hard problem,
savin’ your presence, Jerry; an’ I couldn’t decide as
quickly as the sea-farin’ gentleman wished. Besides, I
was confused by the attentions of the other gentleman,
a movie actor, who had come along in the mornin’.”</p>

<p>“A movie actor!”</p>

<p>“An’ why not?” she demanded. “It’s gettin’ to be
one of the hazardous callin’s, demandin’ courage and
daring. He plagued me so with verses——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>“It was Jawn!” cried Richard.</p>

<p>“Jawn it was,” agreed Phœbe. “He told me outright
to my face—I like a man to speak the truth—that
he had been disappointed in love some seventy or
eighty times, but that now he had discovered that all
his excitin’ past was just preliminary training to get
him ready and fit for me. But he took me best of all
by his main argument. He said that he had just
finished a fine weddin’ hymn, an’ that it was a shame
to waste it. To be sure, he admitted that he had writ
it for a lady who had gone off with another fellow; but
with a slight change here and there, which would not
spoil the rhyme and metre at all, he found it would
just do for me. An’ then he read it to me.... It
was <i>very</i> seducin’ verse, <i>very</i> seducin’!”</p>

<p>Phœbe was a natural actress. She had the one
quality essential to all great players, the subtle voice
tones which compel an audience to take the contagion of
her mood. In one deft speech she had removed the
awkwardness from the atmosphere and had substituted
ease and friendliness. Jerry and Richard chatted and
chaffed in total forgetfulness of their strained relationship.
It was a wonderful dramatic achievement.</p>

<p>“Phœbe, you cannot mean to marry Walter?”
Jerry asked abruptly. “The thing fills me with
horror. Why, he is six years younger! We cannot
let you sacrifice yourself like that. You are not
really going to do it, are you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Phœbe quietly. “I am not. I thought
at first that I could do it. It’s no worse than nursing
or school-teachering, and a woman must have some sort
of occupation nowadays.” As she spoke she felt a
momentary shame for her flippancy; but she went on,
true to her instinct to hide the good in her, and even to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
deny it if too closely prodded. “The job was too
much for Saint Phœbe.”</p>

<p>“But have you told Walter? Aren’t you afraid
he’ll——”</p>

<p>“He’s all right. We’ve talked things out. There’s
a man in charge of that boy——”</p>

<p>“What man?” Jerry looked toward Richard.</p>

<p>“A man named Walter, whom few of you seem to
know much about. It’s himself I mean. He thinks
he’s doing it for me; and I let him think so; but he’s
really out of my hands now. And one of these days,
when he gets a good, sure grip on himself, I’ll match-make
him off so secretly that neither he nor she will
ever know that I planned it all myself.”</p>

<p>“She? Why, who——”</p>

<p>“Well,” she mused, “I’m not sure. If he keeps on
the way he’s goin’ it’ll be one of the Fernzie girls, the
younger one, maybe. But if he improves a lot, I may
pick out an Armstrong or a Sheppard!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Jerry. Only a native could understand
the prodigiousness of that colossal joke.</p>

<p>The talk drifted here and there, always subject to
Phœbe’s clever will; and when she made some joking
remark about the use of her cottage as a public bathing
pavilion, and in the same breath announced that whatever
those two “gallivanters” intended to do the rest
of the night, she was going to her bed, the moment was
right for Richard to raise two fingers mutely, “Let’s
go swimmin’,” and for Jerry to fling up the answer,
“All right.”</p>

<p>It was an outlandish thing to do, but what water
lover could resist? The night was warm, the Lake was
waveless, and the lump of a moon lighted up the scene.</p>

<p>Richard was waiting on the dock for her. A light in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
Phœbe’s room went out, and still he waited. For a
moment he feared that Jerry had changed her mind, or
perhaps had played a trick on him and had gone out
the rear door and had fled home. Then the light
downstairs went out suddenly; he heard the front door
close with a click, and out of the shadow of the
house he discerned the lithe brown figure moving
towards him.</p>

<p>Somehow they did not plunge off instantly, as had
been their habit. Instead, they stood on the edge of
the dock and talked. He spoke of the new life opening
before him; and he told her of his father, of his life of
pathetic isolation. The pity of it struck her, and she
showed it in her voice and in her eyes. Her hand
touched his arm in sympathy.</p>

<p>Then Richard, who was a man first and a swimmer
after, succumbed to the enchantment of the brown being
before him and began again the vehement avowals
which had never been quite completed to his satisfaction
in the summer-house.</p>

<p>“Say you will marry me, Jerry,” he persisted. “I
want you and I will have you! I won’t let you go!
Will you marry me, Jerry? Will you? Will you?”
with much unoriginal repetition of the same sort.</p>

<p>“No!” she said. He persisted in asking; but she
said, “No!” Nothing daunted, he began all over
again and grew even a shade more insistent.</p>

<p>The world and its ugly sneer began to fade away, but
she fought against her growing irresolution. It was
folly, but it was her best instinct, too. Every right
marriage has in its history somewhere the struggle that
precedes surrender. And years of Virginia tradition
had put the seal of necessity on this final struggle. A
Wells would force the tribute of conquest and capture!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>“No!” she said vehemently. “No!” He would
not be answered and took a step nearer, but she put
out a hand as if to ward him off. “No!” she cried,
almost hysterically, plunged into the water and struck
off into the Lake.</p>

<p>He followed quickly. She was aiming straight towards
the farther shore, and going forward at a dangerous
pace. Fear seized him. With terrific strokes he caught
up to her and begged her to come back, but she shook
her head wildly and went desperately on. He promised
that he would never pester her again, but she was blind
to persuasion. So he kept at her side, although it
tested his powers, swimming in silence, and watching
every stroke with the keenest anguish.</p>

<p>Shortly she slowed up, and later turned on her back
and floated. He waited until he thought the rest had
brought back her strength and then coaxed her to
return. For answer she began swimming onward again,
this time with her long easy sweep; and he followed
without a word.</p>

<p>She was in no condition for a distance swim. The
day had worn her down, and the night’s excitement
had not helped; but she summoned her will and swung
steadily on. On, on, on, they went while shore faded
off and the great white moon filled the night.</p>

<p>Within a hundred yards of the shore she faltered.
He reached quickly for her, but she cried out incoherently
and struck at him. The last few yards was an
agonizing attempt to reach the shallow water. She
was threshing wildly, and calling on him blindly to
“keep away!”—although he had not offered again to
touch her—when her foot reached bottom; she tried to
stand but could not, and fell upon her face. He picked
her up, but she pushed him aside and stumbled on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
the shore, where she dropped prone upon the grass,
thoroughly spent.</p>

<p>He did not know what to say, fearing that his words
might do further damage, so he sat mutely beside her
and listened to her hysteric weeping, and suffered
torments.</p>

<p>While he was waiting, a light flared up in Phœbe’s
cottage, and later he heard the clear rhythm of rowlocks.
The distance straight across the Lake at this
point was probably three-quarters of a mile, and, no
doubt, in the stillness of the night the sound of every
exclamation had floated over the flat water and had reverberated
in Phœbe’s room. The old Indian tradition
that each year Keuka will take her toll of five had been
all too often verified; so the Lake dwellers were trained
to listen keenly when unusual cries came over the water.</p>

<p>In the white moonlight every object was clear, clearer,
it seemed, even than day. So Richard rose quietly, went
to a knoll a few feet away, and stood and waved his
arm. After a time he saw the boat change its course
and knew that Phœbe had marked him. Then he went
back and sat on guard over the prostrate swimmer.</p>

<p>She was quieter now and, save for occasional swift
shudders, her breathing had become almost normal.
Suddenly she started to her feet, and made for the Lake.</p>

<p>“You are not going to swim back?” he protested.</p>

<p>She made no answer, and stepped into the shallow
water; but he stood before her and seized her boldly in
his arms.</p>

<p>“I will not let you go!” he spoke firmly, and tightened
his grasp. She struggled and cried out upon him
and told him that he was hurting her, but he drew her
to him and was thankful for his strength. And all the
while he talked to her, telling her things that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
told her many times before, matters which he had given
his solemn word would never be broached again; acting,
indeed, like the most and the least intelligent of swains.
He used phrases that have been iterated since the world
began to swim in space; there was not a spark of
originality in him!</p>

<p>For a minute or two she tried her little powers
against him; then suddenly she gave in, sobbing like
a very contented child. She reached her arms slowly
up and put them about him, and clung to him and
confessed her complete surrender.</p>

<p>Proud Miss Piddiwit had melted quite away.</p>

<p>And thus they stood when the boat grated on the
shelving shore and Phœbe drew in the oars, and turned
about and faced them. She was again in her blue
kimono and her wonderful hair fell in its broad braids.</p>

<p>“The saints in heaven!” she ejaculated. “An’ have
I got up out o’ me bed an’ rowed clear across the Lake
only to spoil a pretty picnic party! An’ with the
yellin’ and the splashin’ it’s drowned I thought ye were!
What do you mean by disappointin’ me like that!”</p>

<p>Out of the boat leaped Phœbe, not caring at all for
six inches of water, and swooped down upon Jerry.</p>

<p>“Angel-child!” she cried as she reached to draw the
wet brown form to her. “Don’t let that big piggy
have <i>all</i> the huggin’!” Jerry tottered into her wide-opened
arms. “Dear-a-dear! Dear-a-dear!” Phœbe
soothed as she rocked her precious burden to and fro.
“An’ it’s cryin’ ye are!... An’ well ye may! An’
well ye may!... An’, by the cross of Saint Michael,
it’s cryin’ myself I am!”</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
